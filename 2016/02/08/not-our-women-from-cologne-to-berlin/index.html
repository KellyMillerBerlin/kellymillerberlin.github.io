                    <p>Middle class and low-income white men
                        are<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/opinion/white-americas-broken-heart.html?_r=0">
                            suffering from &#8220;broken hearts&#8221;</a>, Bill Clinton told a crowd of Hillary Clinton
                        supporters this month. They&#8217;re looking for ways to feel strong again, less power-less in
                        the face of &#8220;great demographic change,&#8221; he continued. Increasing rates of a certain
                        type of immigration compounded with a decline in the legitimacy of traditional masculinity, in
                        which only dudes could consume mass-market beer (see
                        <a href="http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/coors-light-campaign-women-drinkers-mind/302334/">Coors&#8217;
                            inclusion of women in their advertising</a>) and be celebrated for their singular
                        athleticism (see U.S. women&#8217;s World Cup victory), are having grave effect: The mortality
                        rate for white men is increasing, not declining, as compared to other groups, Bill C.
                        emphasized.</p>
                    <p>Sure, this data could be interpreted to mean that white men are in crisis. Yet it could also be
                        interpreted as a re-distribution of territorial domains. White men, no longer allowed to consume
                        and stock-pile exorbitantly more than their fair share, are thus bearing the brunt of what the
                        rest of us face (to varying degrees): the strain of child-rearing and poor-paying jobs, social
                        stigma and disrespect, and broken promises by our most trusted institutions.</p>
                    <p>Whether or not this latter interpretation is the correct one is worthy of debate; however, this
                        is not the article with which to properly frame and carry out this debate. Rather, I would like
                        to begin a discussion on the significance and impact for women and for immigrants of this
                        declining white male power. Although Bill Clinton would surely prefer for me to focus on the
                        United States, Germany will be the setting &#8211; a country witnessing the simultaneous effects
                        of the white male crisis (from now on referred to as <strong>WMC</strong>) and the increase of
                        immigrants from majority Muslim countries, where gendered power operates within very different
                        historical parameters.</p>
                    <p>Germany&#8217;s position as key humanitarian actor in the refugee crisis and the role of its
                        leader, a woman, in steering and driving EU and regional responses to the crisis, make it all
                        the more compelling as far as WMC and demographic change are concerned. The very recent attacks
                        on women in Cologne, in which more than 100 young women were violated physically, sexually, and
                        personally (in any combination) by presumed immigrants and asylum applicants* provide a precise
                        situation on which to base a discussion of WMC. The framework for this discussion begins in the
                        fall of 2015, namely with Germany&#8217;s decision to shoulder much of the burden of the Syrian
                        conflict.</p>

                    <p>As it became clear this past August that the staggering flows of those fleeing to Europe would
                        not ebb, the European Union began to see the task of absorption and processing no longer as a
                        matter of will but of inevitability. In confronting the situation, quotas for the distribution
                        of asylum applicants to
                        <a href="http://themigrationist.net/2015/10/07/refugee-quota-the-end-of-the-eu-or-the-beginning-of-collective-humanitarianism/">each
                            of the 28 member states were passed</a>; the numbers initially named were quickly surpassed
                        by an increasingly grim reality; and certain states balked at EU Commission attempts to enforce
                        said quotas. And people kept coming, washing up dead or alive.</p>
                    <p>Germany, as the largest economy and most populous country in the EU, then began to go it
                        alone: Angela Merkel (and her coalition government) bypassed the gates of EU political
                        convention,
                        <a href="https://meta.tagesschau.de/id/102472/merkel-weist-verantwortung-fuer-fluechtlingsandrang-zurueck">effectively
                            eliminating the so-called Dublin III protocol for those migrants and recognized refugees
                            with a Syrian passport</a>. Instead of languishing in the overwhelmed border camps and
                        courts of Greece, Malta, and Italy, hundreds of thousands were now free to head by train and
                        foot and truck northward toward Germany, their nationality allowing them passage in a system
                        otherwise characterized by strict enforcement of where-you-put-your-foot-down-first
                        jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>In this political moment, in this shift from common EU debate and problem-solving to geopolitical
                        activism, Angela Merkel came to symbolize the potential for a woman&#8217;s leadership in crisis
                        (for which the world has far too few examples, by nature of the big P [patriarchy]). For many
                        refugees, in particular, she came to embody a sort of migration-maternalism: a woman opens her
                        arms to millions of displaced human beings, largely Muslim; <em>her</em> country embraces them;
                        and, although a tough reality of asylum proceedings** awaits, they may come and be cared for in
                        the interim.</p>
                    <p><strong>Then, sounding like the crescendo long-awaited by right-wing populists, the attacks on
                        New Year&#8217;s Eve in Cologne occurred. </strong></p>
                    <p>For those not yet familiar with the details of the Cologne attacks, here is a quick and fairly
                        accurate summation, gleaned from multiple news sources that have worked to continually revise
                        and update their assessments of the situation in real-time:</p>
                    <p>Late on the eve of the New Year, a band of men carried out a series of coordinated frisks,
                        assaults, and robberies in and around Cologne&#8217;s large and iconic train station. The
                        <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/10/462558773/night-of-shame-week-of-soul-searching-cologne-attacks-divide-germany">Associated
                            Press reported</a> a total of 379 criminal complaints, with 40% including allegations of
                        sexual assault (inappropriate touching, groping, and even rape). Police reports initially
                        described the suspected men as &#8220;refugees&#8221; before details had been confirmed,
                        <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cologne-attacks-trigger-raw-debate-on-immigration-in-germany-a-1071175.html">Spiegel
                            Online reported</a>. Victims interviewed described men of Middle Eastern and North African
                        appearance. This information was then passed on to the press and reassembled into a series of
                        articles and shock-mongering headlines.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://There were thirty-two suspects identified: nine Algerians, eight Moroccans, five Iranians, four Syrians, three Germans, one Iraqi, one Serb, and one American. Many more should be located as investigations commence. Yet we do know that 22 of the suspects are asylum applicants - trying to gain refugee status for themselves.">The
                            New Yorker writes</a> that of the 32 suspects identified, 9 were Algerian, 8 were Moroccan,
                        5 were Iranian, 4 were Syrian, 3 were German, and 3 were Iraqi, Serb, and American,
                        respectively. This makes for a group a bit more multicultural than the police and the press led
                        the public to believe. The article goes on to write &#8220;we do know that 22 of the suspects
                        are asylum applicants.&#8221; The
                        <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Mitschrift/Pressekonferenzen/2016/01/2016-01-08-regpk.html">German
                            government has since confirmed</a> that more than merely a few of the suspects were in the
                        midst of asylum proceedings.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps most important to the Cologne event is not what we know about these criminals but what we
                        know about the effects of their behavior.</p>
                    <p>It took only a few hours for a certain voice to dominate the German airwaves, calling for the
                        protection of &#8220;our women&#8221; against the in-compatibility of largely Muslim newcomers,
                        or a narrative of an Oriental Other assaulting Germany&#8217;s young and female. It did not help
                        that this discussion began on the sidelines; official accounts and both public and popular media
                        arrived painfully late.</p>
                    <p>Right from the start, Cologne police failed to promptly inform the public, in part out of fear
                        that Germany&#8217;s growing Nativist movement would run with not yet substantiated suspicions,
                        leading to
                        <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-refugee-hostel-attacks-on-the-rise-a-1027994.html">more
                            attacks on asylum housing and processing facilities than the increasing incidence the
                            country had already been forced to publicly confront (and condemn)</a>. The public TV
                        network ZDF failed to report the attacks in a timely fashion, a whole four days late to be
                        precise. Word initially broke from unofficial sources, namely from neighborhood activists and
                        victims who took to social media. Yet initial caution by journalistic publications soon gave
                        way to reductionist interpretations of the night in question, most notably in illustrated form
                        at two prominent news sources.</p>
                    <p>The newspaper giant <em>Süddeutsche Zeitung</em> used its front page to depict the penetration of
                        a white woman&#8217;s pubic region by a pitch black hand. The leading weekly magazine

                    <p>These publications were not right-wing brochures stoking existing flames. They were Germany&#8217;s
                        moderate dailies and weeklies, stoking the fears of a majority trying to hold it all in and,
                        ultimately, together. In other words, fearful and fear-mongering reactions blending women&#8217;s
                        bodies with foreign elements came from the middle of society. Not from the fringe.</p>

                        their reporting on and of the Cologne attacks. It is a frightening moment when citizens trust
                        Facebook posts and tweets more than the national news providers. And when Facebook posts by
                        everyday Germans include statements like &#8220;Where were the girls screaming &#8216;welcome&#8217;
                        this time? Those whores would certainly have loved to have their crotches or tits grabbed by
                        countless hands&#8221;, the trouble seems deeper, stickier, knee-deep in a mess of WMC and

                            politician asked on national German public radio</a> in the days following the attacks. It
                        is no slip of the tongue that a possessive article precedes &#8220;women&#8221;.  Belonging to a
                        place can quickly devolve into sentiments of ownership.</p>
                    <p>Interpreting and responding to the events of Cologne are largely white males in power, be it the
                        incompetent police chief or the parliamentary members who have rushed to pass new asylum
                        legislation. And so, this string of event and response begs the following question: Is the
                        outrage directed toward Cologne&#8217;s perpetrators less about the violation of women and more
                        about the violation of the status quo &#8211; a violation only offensive when committed by
                        outsiders, by non-white, non-native males?</p>
                    <p><strong>The Body-Politic</strong></p>
                    <p>The confluence or, better yet, the conflation of female body, female person, and nation had
                        arrived long before Cologne, before Mama Merkel. History provides countless examples of an event
                        similar to the rhetoric now heard after Cologne, in which nationalism, xenophobia, and
                        socioeconomic flux have coalesced around the female form, thereby rallying around all the ways
                        we choose to represent and activate this gender. These times are also characterized by a similar
                        strain of WMC, caused by WWI national humiliation and WWII national dismantlement,
                        respectively.</p>
                    <p>In Nazi Germany, the female body became both a cherished garden and weapon of the state. The womb
                        was a tool to be pointed directly at the enemy, outnumbering and eliminating their corrupt
                        bloodlines. Women received medals of honor
                        (<i><a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005205">Mutterehrenkreuz</a></i>) for
                        their reproductive service to the nation, and were extolled in propaganda for their virtuosity
                        (though simultaneously sexualized in artistic depictions).</p>

                    <p>In the GDR,
                        <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/the-victims-of-east-germanys-doping-program-are-still-suffering/a-18038630">young
                            women and pre-pubescent girls were taken by the state and trained to be superior
                            athletes</a> in dance and gymnastics. Their bodies were submitted to cruel fitness and
                        hormonal regimes, not to mention sexual and physical abuse, for the sake of the state&#8217;s
                        prestige. If their little bodies could be the strongest and most agile on the global stage, so
                        would the state be seen as an emblem of strength under international socialism.</p>
                    <p>We are now at a similar juncture of the female body, the boundaries of nation and belonging, and
                        the rise of a fear of outsiders &#8211; those beyond our high walls. The moral lines are
                        clearer, with Germany acting as the haven-provider to a great number of human beings, and the
                        gendered terrain more complicated, with confrontational waves of feminism and anti-feminism
                        meeting at the issue of sexual violence.</p>
                    <p>Germany&#8217;s populist conservative party, known for its Nativist and nationalistic language,
                        has seized the issue for the purpose of its own political ascent. This party, which calls itself
                        &#8220;the Alternative for Germany&#8221;*** (in short form AfD), and its
                        supporters have grabbed hold of statements by ordinary, not necessarily right-wing citizens to
                        assert their points across the playing field of internet activism. One such comment
                        appropriated for their messaging: &#8220;Is it for this that I donated half of the contents of
                        my wardrobe? Is this the new Cologne? Is this the new Germany?&#8221;</p>
                    <p>Many frightened and frustrated Germans, men and women alike, now find themselves the target of
                        further right-wing propagandizing and the machinery it seeks to build. Amidst the lack of
                        confidence much of the country has expressed in its leader, Angela Merkel, there are
                        increasingly fewer obstructions in this machinery&#8217;s path.</p>
                    <p>Particularly in Cologne, right-wing movements maintain a dreary precedence. Only a few years ago,

                            on an immigrant district and on immigrant-owned shops in the area</a> left much of Germany
                        stunned. The persistent local neo-Nazi scene, combined with a strong football-hooligan
                        landscape, has made Cologne the stage for many an uncomfortable attack on people who dare to be
                        different.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it is thus no surprise that the right-wing AfD is gaining momentum: For the first time
                        ever, they&#8217;ve reached
                        <a href="http://www.focus.de/politik/videos/waere-am-sonntag-bundestagswahl-neuer-hoechststand-afd-liegt-in-umfragen-bei-13-prozent-der-waehlerstimmen_id_5237952.html">double-digits
                            with 13%</a>. This is no small jump in a parliamentary system, where the majority parties
                        hold 25-30%.</p>
                    <p>The political battlefield has thus become more right-leaning in response to Cologne. Parties like
                        AfD and the Pegida movement are the victors; the victims, i.e. women, have been shoved to the
                        sidelines, it would seem.</p>

                    <p>Many feminist activists have begun to call attention to the way in which certain men have used
                        the Cologne attacks to, again, co-opt women&#8217;s experiences for their own ends. Not only AfD
                        supporters have jumped at the chance to speak of &#8220;our women&#8221; in a tone that decries
                        immigrants; ordinary citizens have found justification for their anti-immigrant feelings in the
                        example of the assaulted woman. &#8216;As if these voices were not also sexist, not also part of
                        a system in which violence against women persists?!&#8217; these activists write. Using the
                        hashtag <a href="http://ausnahmslos.org/">#ausnahmslos</a>, activist women seek to reclaim the
                        discussion from groups with fingers and tongues quick to spread a message of natives-or-else.
                        &#8216;Women&#8217;s safety and respect or else, more like it!&#8217; they respond.</p>
                    <p>The old guard of women&#8217;s rights has since positioned itself in the quick-finger camp. Alice
                        Schwarzer, one of Germany&#8217;s most iconic feminists, now in her 70s,
                        <a href="http://www.aliceschwarzer.de/artikel/das-sind-die-folgen-der-falschen-toleranz-331143">rashly
                            called for the mandatory re-socialization of young immigrant men</a> in order to prevent
                        such attacks in the future. Her vocality in the women&#8217;s rights arena has more
                        traditionally
                        <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/alice-schwarzer-in-der-prostitutionsdebatte-kaeufliche-koerper-kaeufliche-seelen-1.1834875">been
                            associated with the issue of prostitution</a> in Germany, which is legal and thus
                        state-regulated. But on this question of bodies, it would appear that the fear of the foreigner
                        has somehow superseded fear of the consequences of Patriarchy&#8230; or these fears have became
                        one and the same.</p>
                    <p>As #ausnahmslos activists emphasize, sexual violence is not an element foreign to Germany.
                        Barriers to the inclusion of women in the workplace; in the general economy of goods, people,
                        and services; and the social realm, such as the basketball court or nightclub, continue to
                        persist. Stopping the discussion at &#8220;cultural assimilation&#8221; and re-education of
                        foreigners is just another example of an ineffective approach &#8211; ineffective at addressing
                        the systemic perceptions and symbolism that perpetuate violence against women everywhere.</p>
                    <p>Sexual violence and, in particular, violence against women in any form will not stop with the
                        closure of borders or with the re-education of millions of Muslims. To boot, millions of Muslims
                        already respect and honor the rights and bodies of women. And millions of Muslims are already of
                        the understanding that they will adopt the norms of their new society as far as safety and
                        well-being of their neighbors is concerned. For this problem of gender subjugation, disrespect,
                        and a negative power differential (favoring the Almighty Male) will transcend and outlive
                        migration. Because power is power anywhere. And injustice is injustice anywhere and elsewhere,
                        as well as right here at home.</p>
                    <p><strong>But Alice Schwarzer may still be right in her comments &#8211; right in its
                        <em>affect</em>. For is it not right to be just a little scared, and to respond in
                        kind?</strong></p>
                    <p>No matter how much one would like to see this event as complex and thus respect its complexity,
                        fear of the Other and an increased frustration with Germany&#8217;s role in shouldering the
                        refugee burden is fully justified. Even for those suffering from WMC.</p>
                    <p>This fear &#8211; that newcomers will disrupt the existing social order, will displace and
                        threaten our bodies and livelihoods &#8211; is not without logical, emotional, and even physical
                        (that is, viscerally experienced) reason. Violence, though particularly sexual violence, is
                        offensive in all the ways the actions of human beings toward other human beings can offend,
                        particularly as this offense relates to the national mythology of belonging, of mother-land or
                        father-land. The female body is a battlefield or, better, a litmus test for just how much we can
                        welcome outsiders, and for when we will lash out at them with prods of cultural reductionism,
                        instead. Especially when this tendency to lash out and reduce can be therapeutic.</p>
                    <p>It is a great challenge of conscience and certainly of policy to admit that fear and mistrust is
                        valid, as concerns the more than 1 million asylum applicants who Germany will have welcomed
                        (albeit temporarily) by spring. But only by legitimizing and honoring this fear can we begin to
                        confront the entanglement of sexism, violence, and cultural change. Preparing society for this
                        shift must begin with a validation and recognition that all this will be difficult and wrought
                        with growing pains. Otherwise, fears can fester.</p>
                    <p>As can be witnessed on the other side of the Atlantic, when the fears of a large class of
                        individuals goes unrecognized, it can lead to reactionary populism. Donald Trump&#8217;s loyal
                        followers

                        Pegida and the AfD loan German men the agency they feel they lack in the face of massive
                        cultural change and EU politics, even if this means taking the country away from all the people
                        who are different and honor difference. Added to existing WMC, Germany could be in for the type
                        of election that introduced certain historical cowboys and charismatic soldiers to the ranks of
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>But coddling and stroking the threatened will not prevent the growth of right-wing extremism in
                        the United States or Germany, nor do these fears warrant more than brief validation. Fear may be
                        legitimate, but it is neither productive nor is it right. For the hearts of white men may be
                        broken. But so are the bodies of too many women. And so are the lives of too many refugees.</p>

                    <p>**Asylum applicants refer to precisely that: individuals who do not yet hold UNHCR (official)
                        refugee status, but are seeking this status through the adjudication process of the country for
                        which they are applying for asylum. Germany evaluates the &#8220;believability&#8221; or
                        plausibility of each applicant&#8217;s claim to political and personal persecution endangering
                        their life. This process once took years, has now been largely accelerated to operate a
                        revolving door, moving those out who do not meet asylum requirements and moving those in who
                        wish to submit an application.</p>
                    <p>The source for the social media quotes was initially this
                        <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cologne-attacks-trigger-raw-debate-on-immigration-in-germany-a-1071175.html">excellent
                            article at Spiegel Online</a>, which was verified by a bit of my own digging. Continue to
                        follow the discussion on twitter, by searching &#8220;#ausnahmslos&#8221; or &#8220;#koeln&#8221;.
                        The field and its actors are sure to shift further in the coming months.</p>
