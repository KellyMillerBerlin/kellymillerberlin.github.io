										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I visited my good friend D who, like me, is an American transplant*. We have similar trajectories and political ponderings, though his roots lie far from mine in the American Deep South (here’s a <a href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/place_where_you_live/view/chunky_mississippi_7753/">beautiful piece</a> he wrote about his home in Mississippi). D now lives in East London, where the corner store owner greets you in an upbeat banter and the sign to a ‘Carolina Fried Chicken’ joint dances in the light from the neighboring gastropub. Multicultural, maybe. But London’s multiculturalism has a few faces and facades. And, in the end, it’s the people that matter more than the cultural installation.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3351 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg" alt="img_1031-e1413145767969" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>My first night in London, over pints at a very hip and haptic microbrewery – the tables grainy and splitting with moisture – D and I discuss our common struggles: We chat about how so-called experiences ‘abroad’ are, in the end, defined by labor market restrictions and the particular brand of our passport. Three years ago I would have insisted that these things are fluid. But even with a class degree from a class English university, a work allowance is hard to come by if not impossible in an academic job market already squeezed by its nationals, he shares. I can only nod, my plunge into the newest Berlin job search looming at the edge of my half-empty pint.</p>
<p>Berlin, like London, is full of transplants, both temporary and permanent. Why so many? For the case of my friend D and me, why did we, in particular, take these leaps? Why do so many of our generation (and even those generations before us) move to cities in countries we have no <i>de facto</i> right to be in? Across the ocean, <i>jus soli</i>, <i>jus sanguinus</i>, <i>jus</i> whatever does, indeed, determine much of what is possible.</p>
<p>The U.K, though London, in particular, invites dreams and dreamers. Multiculturalism results, in part, from the diversity of all those who believe in possibility; immigrants churn up new identities and make places we feel right to inhabit. In the case of Americans in London, maybe it’s the common language, the similar sarcastic humor, or the attachment to butter-heavy things like pie and cookies, but it just makes sense to come here.</p>
<p>In D’s apartment, a short assemblage of brick and concrete in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Hackney">Hackney neighborhood</a>, I meet a few other fellow Americans. In many words, we all speak of the hurdles one must leap (in stride) for the right to not only remain but to earn an income at that, to really participate in a place one might co-construct but for which legal rights are lacking. One of them, a recent graduate of the London School of Economics, is tirelessly working to bend a clause or make a rule that will allow him to stay. There is a sense of marathon-running in the air, trying and trying until you can’t try anymore. Particularly palpable in a generation used to succeeding at most things, or told it is possible anyway.</p>
<p>But sometimes, it just doesn’t work out, at least temporarily, and many of those who come have to return to the places they left behind. But D seems optimistic.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3350 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3-464x650.jpg" alt="dylan_3" width="464" height="650" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3.jpg 464w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></a></p>
<p>This matters because cities like London and Berlin actively foster the transplant spirit, but this doesn’t mean that these places work to sustain it. According to recent research <a href="http://books.google.de/books?id=Cy7FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=%22migrants+or+expatriates+americans+in+europe%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bX6_r-fwO2&amp;sig=4Si_8b_0M8yuiU9Ti6hBkJ_Ijs8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M8IqVJW1IsbWPZzygOAN&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">on so-called American expatriates in Europe</a>, many transplants struggle for years at poorly paid jobs that are taken just to remain in the country. In Berlin, nearly half are underemployed and another third report contract-to-contract work (hustling, in other words). And yet, despite difficulties, many stay, which may be part financial, the costs of rehabilitating a life somewhere else, for example, and part mythical, i.e. what it means to constantly imagine future potential, then find it too difficult to forgo what might have been.</p>
<p>In any case, staying has a lot to do with the appearance of things. For how much of the transplant culture results from what one sees or experiences upon arriving, regardless of the actual rules of the game, even in spite of real barriers to inclusion? Put simply, if I see other Americans making it, or just a plethora of other nationalities making it, is it wrong to think I’ll make it?</p>
<p>Of course, the particular brand of passport produces a variety of experiences, but very few of us have a free-pass (excluding what D jokingly refers to as ‘fake Americans’ in London who legally remain in the country under an inherited European passport). Now, sitting in D’s kitchen with a liter of freshly brewed coffee (not tea), he tells me another story, one of a good friend’s predicament – an EU citizen, married to a Mexican national. In short, the immigration authorities of the U.K. have decided that the couple fails to meet requirements for residency in London, he tells me. Mexico is a country not seen favorably for transplantation; a hierarchy of acceptable migrants certainly does exist. But this all feels strangely hypothetical – this game of planning a life beyond borders, making moves and readying oneself for the counter. It is a lesson in rectifying a roster of rules with a vibrant diversity suggestive of more flexibility, more fluidity, than might be the case.</p>
<p>We leave the apartment and its conversation for a walk. Outside, it’s humid but pleasant, and the streets of D’s neighborhood are bursting with an eclecticism even beyond what the NY Times recently featured in ‘<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/travel/36-hours-in-east-london.html">36 hours in East London</a>‘ (as if the region needed its own holiday, apart from the financial men and women in suits of central London or the manicured streets of the West). Here, social housing projects tower above quaint town homes, neighbors trimming their rose bushes, bass piling out of a high window onto a long set of shears. Just down the road, one of London’s most bubbling food bazaars – a foodie’s scene of cultural consumption – is in full swing. Broadway Market: where German sausages, and meat pies, and lox bagels, and Persian kebab, and samosas, and ramen-to-go find frequent (young) patrons. We both delight in the anything-but-discordant multilingualism this variety yields.</p>
<p>In a pod of food carts just blocks from the market’s main drag, I find the best burrito I’ve had outside of the Western United States – a man with an air of L.A. dishing up marinated legumes, sauces streaming out of all sides of the tortilla like a blessing. A neighboring kiosk serves up what they call Filipino wraps (pork belly, assorted greens, tangy sauce), D’s favorite. As I walk to peruse other flavors, D shares his visa predicament with the owner of the wraps, explaining that this sandwich will be his last after a year of patronage. The owner offers to sponsor his visa, chuckling but serious, D tells me. Maybe he should take him up on his offer we joke, meaning it. D smiles.</p>

<p>It’s easy to feel welcomed here.</p>
<p>Far away from East London, I find myself in the kitchen of a German transplant on the ground floor of an elderly but charming home in a neighborhood near Kensington.  From my luggage I unload mustard I’ve carted across the channel, tubes I was almost not allowed to take onto the plane. <i>You just can’t find this here</i>, my host says, that certain spicy mustard.</p>
<p>Her friends are all from somewhere else, she shares, <i>but the problem with transplants is that they all leave eventually, and then, all of a sudden, you don’t have any friends</i>. She is slowly rebuilding the circle, <i>but it’s hard</i>, she tells me, <i>when everyone is from somewhere else.</i></p>
<p>As we leave the far West neighborhood, its quiet lanes juxtaposed with newer blocks of community housing and industrial outgrowth, we pass an office for remittances – transplants from East Africa sending their earnings back ‘home’. Even here, some people are making it.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3347 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001.jpg" alt="wp_20140919_001" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>My last day in London, my travel companion and I board a train to Brick Lane, snaking above a meat market, halal lambs hanging like carpets and voices rising up into numbers. Brick Lane, a curated experience of all that London attracts, the object of film, book, and tourism, is the sharpened edge of the city’s sale of eclecticism. It is a blend of curry houses and backdoor sweets shops for tourists and locals alike; it is the contrast between posh chocolatiers and wholesale textile vendors or between grunge coffee houses and chic boutiques. But it is not what is seen here that inspires but what is implied: that this – reproduction of home, community-making in memory – is possible. Even if it always isn’t.</p>
<p>After another burrito, this time seasoned with garam masala, we chat with an artist crafting overt social commentary, something he calls ‘the Prejudice Project’. With a long beard and dark eyes, he has likely faced that which his project targets. His bright smile opens up to pure optimism as we discuss diversity politics, however. But things can be difficult, indeed: In London, it’s not as free as in Berlin, he shares, a place he once inhabited, squatting in Köpenick and composing works that now hang in this design outlet just off Brick Lane. <i>The folks here are different</i>, he says, pausing, belonging to a <i>certain type</i>. He gives me a postcard, <i>a token to remember our conversation</i>: ‘#Paradise’ printed on a white surface, a glimpse of blue sky in the background.</p>
<p>D is moving back to the United States. After a preliminary job search and the weight of a different kind of bureaucracy on his shoulders, it seems like the best thing, for now. As he prepares for his departure to Philadelphia he looks mournful, visiting his favorite food carts and bookshop, the dingy canal with folks living out of boats – the air thick with oil and wet brush – before it all becomes just another place where he once lived. <i>I’d like to come back</i>, he says, <i>but then I just walk around and look at all the people here and want to go up and ask ‘like, how do you live here? What do you do?’</i> Perhaps, many of them are themselves transplants, just figuring it out as they go, leaving eventually for another place.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say, given the look of things.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1035.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3348 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1035.jpg" alt="img_1035" width="640" height="295" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1035.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1035-300x138.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p>*I am using this word “transplant” intentionally, avoiding terms such as “expat” or even “immigrant”, as they are often bogged down with allusions to class, privilege, and assumptions about the irrelevance of borders or passports for certain members of the global community. When it comes to migration, the language is tricky but important. It helps to start with words that we feel we truly inhabit or experience, even if imperfectly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The relationship between food and identity, or simply food and a sense of belonging, is well-known to those of us who have sought out Hass avocados or Toll House chocolate chips (often in vain) in places beyond the United States. For me, there is something ultimately gratifying, even safe, about opening that jar of Adam&#8217;s peanut butter or letting the smell of buttermilk biscuits fill my Berlin apartment. At once, giving in to &#8216;old urges&#8217; is washed with self-realization. I also just really love buttermilk biscuits.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01329.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2518" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01329.jpg?w=640" alt="DSC01329" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>While critically testing Berlin&#8217;s newest &#8216;American breakfast&#8217; joint a few weekends ago, I had the overwhelming sense that &#8220;hey, I&#8217;m allowed to do this [more than anyone else here]!&#8221;. These are processes of identity and belonging at work.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cabslam">California Breakfast Slam</a>, or CABslam, originally a pop-up breakfast establishment celebrating Americana classics like hash browns and maple syrup-drenched bacon, now hosts an unassuming &#8216;Beta&#8217; restaurant space at the far edge of Neukölln&#8217;s Reuterkiez. A visit allows for the giddy return to childhood memories that lead to goosebumps and pride or a combination of both. Let&#8217;s call this the California Breakfast Slam effect.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01342.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2531 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01342.jpg?w=640" alt="DSC01342" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>
<p>Not all patrons of CABslam&#8217;s new digs are from the Western coast of the United States like myself, but there certainly exists a clientele of the North American variety, motivated more by feelings (or longings) than by taste, I dare to conjecture. Put simply, who knew that a plate full of pancakes, browned potato shavings, bacon, and a fried egg would make one feel so secure? So &#8216;you&#8217; in your own maple-craving skin? This is the CABslam effect.</p>
<p>Anthropologists would suggest that our food choices constitute a large part of how we position ourselves in the world, particularly in a foreign context. In a country for which one possesses no legal or innate right to reside, one learns to miss the general social acceptance and security provided in that <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/16/lens-going-away/">place left behind</a>. Ethnographical studies* of immigrants around the world &#8211; Turkish immigrants vending kebap to keep the nostalgic grill burning, taco trucks re-connecting small towns to distant landscapes, Punjabi import shops outlining a community in the anonymous city &#8211; form an extensive literature in support of this role of food as an identity-maker. Food ways, what and how we eat, often serve to reclaim a definition of self that may be threatened by the indifferent surroundings of the foreign.</p>
<p>Interesting to reflect upon, however, is how much of these positive associations are, in fact, related to the food itself. In other words, is it the constitution and consistency of the yogurt that reminds the Turkish immigrant of home (see <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-31/at-chobani-the-turkish-king-of-greek-yogurt">the Chobani story</a>)? Is the sugar content of my peanut butter a key determinant of my sense of belonging &#8211; of how I affirm and embody my American identity in Germany?</p>
<p>One of my father&#8217;s favorite activities, as of late, is going to the local mom &amp; pop diner located just around the corner from his home. He has always loved waffles, bacon, eggs &#8211; preferences I inherited, minus the bacon for environmental reasons (goodbye bacon bowls).</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img_20041.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2555 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img_20041.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_2004" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>At this local breakfast spot in Vancouver (WA), one sits in a cozy corner &#8211; on that particular kind of squeaky upholstery reserved for diners &#8211; and receives bottom-less coffee and a pint of the good, brown sticky stuff within moments of arriving, without needing to have asked. Luxury and simplicity come together in a routinized ritual that completes a Saturday morning.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img_20051.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2556 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img_20051.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_2005" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>A visit to Neukölln&#8217;s diner-ish mock up, CABslam, offers a similar experience, albeit with wood in place of the traditional synthetic materials. The waitresses greet guests in English with a smile, a touch of accent on the tongue; plates of meat, starch, and sugar pass through the spacious, half-finished space, disturbed only by the squeal of espresso. Oh, American breakfast in Europe: such a strange delicacy, indeed.</p>
<p>If I were to come upon a similar diner anywhere in the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2014/01/21/beyond-berlin-difference-in-the-wet-country/">Pacific Northwest</a>, I would be confused by 1. the small portions, 2. the texture of the syrup, 3. the small portions, 4. the fancy coffee, and 5. the small portions. But while in that strange space of not always quite fitting in and not being quite sure how to amend the problem, one takes any moment of assured (if strangely assembled) belonging and identity one can get.</p>
<p>And so I ordered French toast, Juri ordered the original California Breakfast Slam, and I ate his pancakes and felt thoroughly pleased with the entire situation.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01335.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2524" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01335.jpg?w=640" alt="DSC01335" width="640" height="960" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01335.jpg 433w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01335-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Glancing around the perhaps far-too spacious-to-be-cozy restaurant-in-progress, plates of beans and eggs (Huevos Rancheros!),  yellow sauce and bread (Eggs Benedict!), and hearty scrambles made it all just believable enough&#8230;even if it is not possible to get a side of sweet &#8216;Amish bread&#8217; here, as is the case with my favorite diner in Seattle, <a href="http://www.bethscafe.com/index.php">Beth&#8217;s Cafe</a>. Beginnings are always a bit modest, anyway.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01336.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2525 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01336.jpg?w=640" alt="DSC01336" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>After our plates had been cleared, all sauces sopped up with available eatable utensils, I pondered my just-consumed identity and belonging with a nice long sip of espresso. Though perhaps still a bit hungry for American-diner standards, the starvation for the validation that comes from truly fitting in &#8211; in this case, the belonging that comes from just understanding the absurdly starchy rituals that constitute American breakfast &#8211; was momentarily gone.</p>
<p>This felt quite good.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01340.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2529" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01340.jpg?w=640" alt="DSC01340" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>
<p>While consuming something in the morning hours that would otherwise be reserved for a combination of dessert, second dessert, and holidays in Germany, the recognition that &#8220;yes, this is perhaps not the healthiest but yes, this is delicious, and I will enjoy it&#8221; bubbles up, almost unexpectedly.</p>
<p>American food culture is shaped and even manipulated by advertising&#8217;s exploitation of this very urge to give-in, indulge, and consume &#8216;freedom&#8217; as embodied in a fried-chicken-pizza or a Big Gulp &#8211; as nicely laid out in an <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/04/fast-food-doubles-down.html">article on the success of such fast-food antics in America</a> in this past week&#8217;s issue of <em>The</em> <em>New Yorker</em>.</p>
<p>But looking around at the improvisational furniture and faux diner fixtures at CABslam, the abstract and even fictive nature of such an experience became strikingly clear: The setting did not necessarily fit my expectations, but the frame was just large enough to allow textures, smells, and memories to gently assemble a replica of &#8216;home&#8217;. Minus the Amish bread.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01326.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2515" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc01326.jpg?w=640" alt="DSC01326" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>If one were to survey immigrants and/or expats around the world, one thing would surely be held in common &#8211; a lust after the foods of whence one has come. This does not mean that these foods are objectively good or even at the top of my list. But this is not the point. Even though the mere idea of many American delights makes me a little uneasy and sad for the state of national nutrition (see &#8220;<a href="http://www.takepart.com/place-at-the-table">A Place at the Table</a>&#8221; for the full story), I delight just a little in being associated with such a cuisine. Because it is familiar and mine, in a way intimately intertwined with memory and what identity makes of it.</p>
<p>More than anything else, the moments at my childhood-dream-table, where chocolate-chip pancakes were the best reward and hash browns the coveted snack, are the things that bring me the simplest of glee in a situation that is often colored by uncertainty. And that, folks, is the CABslam effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lichtenberg&#8217;s Dong Xuan Center consists of 6 hangars, stocked tightly with all the things one might come to miss living far away from a place, where a broth of cardamom and ginger is paired with any meat imaginable and the most delicate of noodles; where a certain kind of manufacturing can turn out plastic and fabric wares for all sizes and ages in bulk; where sweet things might come packaged in banana leaves, wrapped around sticky mango rice like presents.</p>
<p>Or this is the impression one might get of Vietnam, when visiting Dong Xuan &#8211; a Mecca in the middle of former East Berlin, little Hanoi amidst not so little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plattenbau">Plattenbauten</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/img_0315.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2159" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/img_0315.jpg?w=640" alt="Dong Xuan Berlin" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>There is no one Vietnamese community in Berlin, just as there is no singular American community of expats. There are diverse and diffuse overlapping relationships, preferences, habits, and often a common language. Being Vietnamese in Berlin is a situation-dependent assortment of elements: oft stigmatized for a generation of non-German speakers and black market-dealers, yet praised for being Tiger mothers and turning out the most successful of <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-kinder-ehemaliger-vietnamesischer-vertragsarbeiter-gehoeren-in-den-schulen-zu-den-besten--ihre-eltern-erwarten-das-auch-bildung-statt-bmw,10810590,10627778.html">Germany’s 2nd or even 1st generation of immigrant young people</a>. For reasons stretching back to the Berlin Wall and the divisions in migration statuses it allowed for, i.e. so-called Eastern <em>Vertragsarbeiter </em>(contract workers) and Western &#8220;boat people&#8221;<em>, </em> there is little unity between traditional East and West.</p>
<p>The <i>Vertragsarbeiter </i>were said to activate <a href="http://www.berlin.de/polizei/kriminalitaet/zigarettenhandel.html">cross-border smuggling of highly taxable goods such as cigarettes</a>, while Western refugees were able to integrate into the official job market more effectively with Bonn&#8217;s pledge of support to communism&#8217;s defectors. In the East, there were Asian fast-food stands with cheap beer on the menu; in the West there were the beginnings of the successful entrepreneurial ventures we enjoy today, such as the 4.90 curry specials in establishments with swanky lighting and signature plates. The successful Dong Xuan Center <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html">was founded by a <em>Vertragsarbeiter</em>, a textile salesman from Potsdam</a>. A blend of both strands seems to be the winning recipe.</p>
<div style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html"><img loading="lazy" class="   " title="Owner, Nguyen van Hien" src="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/image/view/2013/5/19/23446162,20209160,highRes,maxh,480,maxw,480,PON_20130607_111.jpg" alt="founder Dong Xuan Center Berlin" width="320" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Owner, Nguyen van Hien (source: <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p></div>
<p>However, there are stereotypes, and then there are impressions.</p>
<p>A visit to Dong Xuan gives an impression of ambition, of making things happen (finding ways to get exotic fish and fake iPhones into the local marketplace, for example), as well as a sense of mutual back-scratching, as demonstrated by the women carrying trays of soup to fellow merchants or the frequent conversations happening at the register. This place seems founded on a need to reclaim or maintain those connections and goods that had been left behind &#8211; by recreating them.</p>
<p>Walking through Dong Xuan is moving through an extensive network of imports and reconstituted experience. Factory fresh button-downs displayed warehouse-style, synthetic-fibered leggings, and strange plastic toys recreate a Costco journey, minus the samples.</p>

<p>Lichtenberg public officials complain of loitering youth fresh off the plane, mothers abusing the social welfare system on behalf of children fathered by ghost German nationals, or a lack of German language acquisition due to the close-knit nature of the East Berlin Vietnamese. But all of these are broad strokes with a pigment that is in reality quite fractured, diffuse, even elusive.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/lb-integration-migration/statistik/pk_praesentation_afs_bed_bf.pdf?start&amp;ts=1301487082&amp;file=pk_praesentation_afs_bed_bf.pdf">5,000</a> Vietnamese residents of Lichtenberg, making up the largest group of non-German born in the district &#8211; 5,000 out of the <a href="http://www.berlin.de/lb/intmig/statistik/demografie/einwohner_staatsangehoerigkeit.html">13,600</a> Vietnamese in all of Berlin. In Lichtenberg, there is now a <a href="http://www.buergerstiftung-lichtenberg.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=132:deutsch-vietnamesische-kita&amp;catid=60:2013&amp;Itemid=86">Vietnamese-German kindergarten</a>, even Vietnamese books in the local library. A &#8216;<a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stille-community-wie-vietnamesen-in-berlin-leben/8799898.html">silent minority</a>&#8216; it is no more, and more than Dong Xuan it is also.</p>
<p>Slowly, fellow Lichtenberg residents or even those from further afield have come to sit in Dong Xuan&#8217;s “authentic Hanoi street food restaurant” or in the barber chair of a salon full of chatty, pink-nailed women. The slightly kitschy set-up of the part establishment part warehouse compartment suggests the difference between the swanky curries of the West and the raw presentation of this Eastern depot, but it is raw in a way that excites and smells delicious.</p>
<p>As the subheading to an <a href="http://www.zeit.de/2013/11/Dong-Xuan-Vietnam-Berlin">article in the prominent German weekly paper <em>die Zeit</em></a> reads, “Here the Vietnamese sell what they prefer, without worrying about what the Germans might like. But the Germans come anyway to find out what Pho really tastes like, the national soup of Vietnam.” Of course, it is unlikely the Germans put as much chili in their soup as the Vietnamese, or that they enjoy additions such as pig ear, for that matter. But walking through the supermarket, one meets the curious non-Vietnamese shoppers, carefully examining the 25 different kinds of rice noodle for the right density, or those laboriously trying to read the ingredients on the jars of chili paste that line the wall, just beneath a row of meat cleavers and unbelievably heavy woks.</p>
<p>I was one of them, feeling like I was experiencing something similar to Hanoi amidst the oppressively ugly architecture of Berlin&#8217;s residential East, no matter how overwhelming at times. It was like being somehow closer to the Vietnamese in Berlin (or in Lichtenberg, anyhow).</p>
<p>But in the end, there might <em>only</em> be the Viet of Dong Xuan Center, a non-representative micocrosm of what it is like to be Vietnamese in Berlin for its members &#8211; thriving businesses and recreated community. <em>Don Xuan</em>, by the way, means &#8220;prosperous meadow&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Berlin&#8217;s &#8220;problem district&#8221; to <a href="http://www.bz-berlin.de/aktuell/berlin/kreuzberg-teurer-als-charlottenburg-article1398469.html">more expensive</a> than <em>spießig</em> Charlottenburg: Kreuzberg&#8217;s made quite the transformation over the decades, but migration continues to shape its identity and reputation as a district.</p>
<p>The bulk of Kreuzberg&#8217;s diversity stems from the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s, when guest workers were recruited by West Germany to fill labor shortages after World War II*. Kreuzberg&#8217;s dilapidated housing became home to guest workers, primarily from Turkey. The district soon came to be known as &#8220;Little Istanbul&#8221;. In 2014 you would still be hard pressed to find a block without a <em>Döner</em> <em>Kebab </em>stand or five, but the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">district&#8217;s diversity</a> extends far past Anatolia.</p>
<p>Along with districts like Neukölln and Wedding, Kreuzberg is renowned for its <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/11/happy-weekend-its-not-about-integration-or-isnt-it/">immigrant integration</a> challenges that include low educational attainment and poor German language skills, high unemployment rates, crime and drug abuse, and gentrification. At the same time, the area has become increasingly attractive to <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/06/multiculturalism-diversity-and-the-big-city/">students</a>, hip expats, and young families. The result is a veritable array of nationalities, cuisines, houses of worship, and attires, as vivid as the graffiti gracing the walls of its gray housing and slender canals.</p>
<p>There are many popular spots in Kreuzberg, but the Maybachufer canal is perhaps one that most poignantly displays the cultural fusion that makes Kreuzberg a very special place to call home.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swans.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swans.jpg" alt="swans" width="594" height="594" /></a></p>
<p><strong>An Ode to the Maybachufer</strong></p>
<p>If I go away, I&#8217;ll remember the swans. And the walls of graffiti they floated along.</p>
<p>Rows of satellite dishes, speckled across gray concrete. Lingerers outside Kaiser&#8217;s, empty bottles at their feet.</p>
<p>Men huddled over pear-shaped glasses of Çay. Girls in tiny shorts and tights, snags in their thighs.</p>
<p>A market with only two rows, but infinite choice. Vendors calling &#8220;lecka! lecka!&#8221;, hints of somewhere else in their voice.</p>
<p>Hair smothered by scarves or impossibly fake dye. Individuals by words: &#8220;expat&#8221;, &#8220;immigrant&#8221;. You or I.</p>
<p>Where &#8220;German&#8221; ends and &#8220;other&#8221; begins, we futilely try to decide.</p>
<p>But the swans. They just keep floating by.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1907" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200.jpg" alt="Rixdorfer1200" width="627" height="351" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just come right out with it: It&#8217;s hard to beat Christmas in Germany. <a href="http://www.gluhweinmix.com/whatisgluhwein.htm"><em>Glühwein</em></a>, cookies, classic lights, decorations strewn across homes and street corners, a <a href="http://german.about.com/library/definitions/bldef_cmas0301.htm">calendar</a>that expects, nay, <em>requires </em>you eat a chocolate per day&#8230; it&#8217;s simply wonderful. Though I grew up in the US, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/26/lens-coming-home/">my family</a> celebrated Christmas the Teutonic way. I have more than fond memories of hiding the <em>Buttergebäck</em> and <em>Lebkuchen</em> in the laundry room from our <em>Opa </em>so he wouldn&#8217;t devour them in one sitting, ripping open a human-size <em>Adventskalendar</em> in the course of one night made by our <em>Oma</em>, and relishing the torture of opening presents one-by-one on Christmas Eve under the illuminated <em>Tannenbaum</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/baum.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1909" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/baum.jpg?w=640" alt="baum" width="604" height="604" /></a></p>
<p>The only thing that was missing on our side of the Atlantic &#8211; and perhaps the pinnacle of Germany&#8217;s Christmas genius &#8211; was the <em>Weihnachtsmarkt.</em> The magical, cheerful Christmas market that makes it socially acceptable to go for a <em>Glühwein</em> at lunch with colleagues and eat your weight in candied almonds and those heart-shaped cinnamon cookie necklaces with cheesy phrases on them (ok, no one <em>actually</em> eats the cookie necklaces). The Christmas market that is part amusement park, part shopping center, part bar, part concert, part house of worship. The Christmas market that makes standing outside for hours in winter a desirable activity.</p>
<p>But Christmas markets aren&#8217;t all about empty calories, booze, and decorations. They&#8217;re also not just there for music, gift shopping, and family/friend time. And &#8211; hear me out &#8211; they&#8217;re not just about religion on either end of the purely-Christian-to-overly-PC-spectrum. In its truest sense, a market is a space for community gathering, exchange, and learning. Which is why when I travel, the market is the first place I turn to for an inside look at a different culture and way of life. A Christmas market can be a place for opportunity as much as it is a place for celebration, regardless of religion, background, gender, age, or anything else. And like Kelly wrote this past summer, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">it&#8217;s about showing up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santa.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1912" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santa.jpg?w=640" alt="santa" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Of course Christmas markets come in all shapes and sizes and with varying levels of kitsch and educational potential. In Berlin, there are the <em>über</em>-commercial markets at all major tourists points throughout the city that focus on food and fun: Alexanderplatz, Zoo, Potsdamer Platz. For those who want to class it up a bit, there&#8217;s Gendarmenmarkt and Schloss Charlottenburg. For a smaller-town feel, and if you&#8217;re willing to make the trek outside the <em>Ring</em>, there&#8217;s Spandau. There are even themed markets, like the <a href="http://www.kadre.de/">Designmarket</a> and <a href="http://weihnachten.tagesspiegel.de/schwedischer-weihnachtsbasar.html">Swedish Christmas Market</a>. There is certainly <em>something for everyone</em>, but I&#8217;ve only been to one Christmas market in Berlin that feels truly modern in its <em>inclusion of everyone</em>, and that&#8217;s the Alt-Rixdorfer Market in <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">Neukölln</a>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Funnily enough, the Alt-Rixdorfer market is more about the past than the future. <em>Alt</em> means &#8220;old&#8221; and is a nod to the neighborhood&#8217;s history which is played out with petroleum lighting, young men acting as the &#8220;town crier&#8221; with old-fashioned megaphones, and pony rides. <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/in-search-of-rixdorf/">Rixdorf</a> has a long and proud history as a Protestant bohemian refugee settlement from the 1700s and retains its old-fashioned and quaint feel to this day. Its identity is more that of small village than city neighborhood, especially when juxtaposed with the hustle and bustle of <em>Karl-Marx Strasse </em>around the corner.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1918" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg" alt="rixdorfdouble" width="470" height="597" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg 470w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble-236x300.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>
<p>But besides these touches of years ago, besides the ubiquitous pork products, candied apples, and singing, the Alt-Rixdorfer market offers something different. The stands are primarily run by local clubs, organizations, and charity groups who display and sell homemade wares, whip up international culinary delights, and advocate for their respective causes. And while the market is still predominantly Christian in framework, it&#8217;s not necessarily Christian in purpose. From where I was standing &#8211; bundled up and elbow-to-elbow with young families, Turkish and Arab youth, homosexual couples, a trail of wheelchairs, and my international friends &#8211; the purpose was inclusion, diversity, and participation. Crawling amongst the hoards from stand to stand, I learned about district issues, was served by special needs residents, bought a handmade card with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa"><em>Hamsa</em></a> on it, munched on Korean fried veggies, and watched kids run around proudly to keep the petroleum lights ablaze. What a more meaningful experience than the usual attempt at diversifying such an event: a Dreidel in one corner and Döner stand in the other with everything else green, red, and factory produced inbetween.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/koreanstand.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1917" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/koreanstand.jpg" alt="koreanstand" width="640" height="640" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/koreanstand.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/koreanstand-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Inclusion&#8221; is a hot topic these days in Berlin, Germany, and beyond. Yet when it comes to who needs inclusion and where, people and politics tend to focus on &#8220;special needs students&#8221; and &#8220;the school&#8221;. What about the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">open Iftar dinner</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">woman led neighborhood tour</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">public gallery</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/21/lens-warm-nights-are-for-cricket/">baseball field</a>, and Christmas market? These are also shared community spaces that can promote inclusion of all residents through interaction, learning, and participation. The Alt-Rixdorfer Market shows us that a small effort to include the entire neighborhood can not only make cold feel warm and old feel new, but make Christmas about community.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What role do embassies play in the lives of foreign nationals abroad? Beyond pure administration and diplomacy, cultural events that allow for a homecoming, a return to childhood, and a bringing together of compatriots might change how immigrants and expats live abroad and the involvement of embassies and consulates therein. The Embassy of Columbia in Berlin sponsored an event that did something just like this. A few weeks ago in Neukölln, Colombians and non-Colombians united over the genius of duck woven into starch - the duck, a true Berliner...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1874" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg?w=640" alt="columbia" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia-300x200.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>What role do embassies play in the lives of foreign nationals abroad? Many of us living in a country for which we do not possess a passport are likely to associate our local embassy with administrative assistance, i.e. replacing documents needed to prove our identity and belonging in the international system. In many public discussions of transnationalism and cosmopolitanism, the nation-state can take on an equally administrative face. <em>It&#8217;s all about technology, no longer about borders or space; the world is post-modern, and so is identity.</em></p>
<p>As the anthropologist <a href="http://www.arjunappadurai.org/">Arjun Appadurai </a>preached in the 1990s, human societies are experiencing a &#8216;deterritorialization&#8217;, making the nation-state less and less relevant for our real lives, its relevance relegated to the small tasks we rely on for bureaucratic systems to function properly.</p>
<p>But it is <em>not </em>this black and white. For those of us who have lived apart from all that was <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/16/lens-going-away/">once familiar and full of memory</a> for a period longer than the term &#8216;abroad&#8217; can afford, the food &#8211; most importantly &#8211; of the former territory of &#8216;home&#8217; becomes something we long for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_fried-plantains.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1875" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_fried-plantains.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_fried plantains" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>And so this rave asks a simple question: What if (nation-)states and their representative institutions abroad played both a symbolic and tangible role in the lives of immigrants holding passports from these places?</p>
<p>There happens to be an example for such, namely the Embassy of Colombia in Germany and its recent culinary festival:</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Sophia and I were invited to this special event, meant to recreate the flavors of many a Colombian childhood in a chic Neukölln space for foodies &#8211; <a href="http://www.feinschlicht.de/">Manufaktur Feinschlicht</a> &#8211; complete with a charming Ambassador and homesick interns. The event was the backdrop to the presentation of a cook book straight out of the homeland, entitled <em>Colombia, Cooking by Regions</em> by Maria Lía Neira Restrepo. With a  full culinary program, using ingredients one can find here in Germany, two worlds were forged on a brisk Berlin evening. This union meant homecoming for some and travel for others.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_candles-table.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1880" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_candles-table.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Candles table" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Renowned chef <a href="http://www.restaurantedianagarcia.com/home.html">Diana Garcia</a>, featured in <em>Colombia, Cooking by Regions</em>, was flown out to Berlin for the event, along with pal, chef Magda Hamon. The two women brought decades of experience, a power house of flavor, and the openness and friendly encounter akin to a family Sunday dinner (for those of us that remember those).</p>
<p>The women were paired with two German chefs &#8211; both looking a bit like they should be flinging fish at Pike Place Market, rather than managing finger foods. In minutes the kitchen and serving foyer were a buzz with the good vibes of cross-cultural collaboration. The Germans, Kai and Robert, filleted brined salmon with rough hands, delicately arranging plates of plantain-based crostini, while the two Colombian ladies tended large cuts of pork belly and whisked various sauces to life in the kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1877" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg?w=640" alt="colombian-embassy-party-001 embassy deriv" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Photo Source: Colombian Embassy</p>
<p>The chefs delivered the beautifully-presented treats to the guests themselves, wandering through the room in white coats, making eye contact with eager mouths, answering questions about ingredients and origin, making all feel welcome to partake in something, well, just great and gluttonous.</p>
<p>Glorifying both the Berlin environs and Colombian roots, it was easy to relate to the enthusiasm and personal connection to the dishes that seemed obvious through taste and composition.</p>
<p>10 waves of savory bites passed through the intimate space where we all gathered around the bar, which never failed to serve up rows of guava-rum puree, delicate glasses of Prosecco, and bottles of rich Colombian wine (both red <em>and </em>white, and both delicious). Surrounded by the chutneys and other jarred creations of <a href="http://www.feinschlicht.de/">Manufaktur Feinschlicht</a>, the ever-increasing guests eyed the prep table and the hall to the kitchen, anxiously awaiting the rolling arrival of new platters and, above all, the kind-eyed and wide-smiled chefs.</p>
<p><em>Colombia is a country of flowers and fruits &#8211; we hope you will taste that! We also love meat, </em>Diana Garcia told the crowd, beaming and laughing a bit in the face of so many cameras.</p>
<p>Pork belly in a muddy water sauce with Berlin&#8217;s (happy) <em>Schwein</em>; fried plantain with a cheese crust; <em>lox</em> on potato-pillows with a healthy dollop of guacamole; breaded and seared scallops on coconut rice (the coconut hailing from the coastal region of Colombia, according to the chefs); creme de leche in pieces big enough to give the teeth something to work on; a creamy pudding enveloping local fruits and Colombian flowers; <em>Currywurst</em> with a bit of guava in the sauce; duck rice with a Berlin-grown bird: all with both decadence and simplicity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_scallop.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1876" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_scallop.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Scallop" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>The young Colombians around me, most of them with positions at the embassy or friends with such coveted diplomatic jobs, celebrated every dish, every reference to summers on the coast, to lunches with grandma, to the country&#8217;s everyday bounty becoming so special through distance.</p>
<p><em>Guava, milk pudding: my favorite things! </em>Hector Sanchez, one of the embassy interns told me, after I openly praised the addition of guava to everything forever and ever. He has <em>been away from Colombia for longer than ever</em>, was studying in Geneva before coming to Berlin, and will be in Berlin for at least one year. <em>I enjoy Berlin because here, everyone fits,</em> even the Colombians. <em>Here I can relax and feel at home</em>, he said, eyeing the second round of <em>Chicharrones</em> and speaking a few adoring words to the room and the chef, the crunchy skin sliding into his mouth.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_hector.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1878" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_hector.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Hector" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>When I asked if it is easy to recreate these Colombian flavors in Berlin &#8211; <em>I have heard that there is a Colombian food store in Mehringdamm, but I&#8217;ve never been there. </em>I couldn&#8217;t seem to find it either. Jaggery, fresh sugar cane, or guava punch are ever elusive, it seems. We talked about the role of the embassy, how such institutions are charged with many often symbolic tasks, such as this one. But it isn&#8217;t symbolic, <em>it reminds me of home</em>, he added.</p>
<p>And so, <em>What do you want Germans to know about Colombia, about Colombians?, </em>I asked, really having no anticipated answer to this question, which is rare, when I choose to ask one. <em>I want them to know that Colombia is changing. It used to be dangerous, but things are getting better. Change, Change! </em>I mentioned that many associate Colombia with films about drug cartels trucking cocaine across the desert in military fatigues. <em>In Bogota it is cold, like 18 degrees all the time and is at a high elevation! And the coastal region is beautiful and where many of these foods come from. You don&#8217;t see that in the</em> <em>movies</em>, he added, a bit flustered. <em> </em></p>
<p>Something about this event &#8211; its emphasis on the cuisine from both the mountainous and the coastal regions &#8211; calls such stereotypes into question.</p>
<p>The Ambassador, dressed in a casual sweater and wearing an academic&#8217;s spectacles, sought eye contact with all in attendance, his wife bejeweled and well-outfitted taking the lead to greet familiar faces. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, indulging and delighting in each and every symbol and real taste of home. The diplomats, other women and men in suits, began to undo ties and remove jackets, as the evening progressed. The room warmed and filled with chatter &#8211; Spanish the dominant language; a few bloggers and friends with mustaches speaking a mix of English and German made the room feel even smaller, though softly lit.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/chandelier-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1883" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/chandelier-2.jpg?w=640" alt="Chandelier 2" width="640" height="657" /></a></p>
<p>After the first two courses had made their rounds, a petite, young woman with a long-lensed camera and a wide grin marched confidently up to our group of wine-drinking Germans and expats, introducing herself with the line: <i>Hi, I&#8217;m from the Philippines! </i>Her husband, standing next to her in somber blacks, works for the Embassy of the Philippines in Berlin. He was raised in Chicago, Seattle, and Russia by a diplomatic father from the Philippines and a Spanish mother. Quite the childhood. Previously, the two had lived in Jakarta, having first met in Manila. Now, she runs a blog on her everyday life as a <a href="http://thediplomaticwife.com/blog/">Diplomatic Wife</a>, with the tagline &#8220;livin&#8217; life DiploStyle&#8221;.</p>
<p>DiploWife seemed to know many faces at the event. She <em>was invited by the Ambassador&#8217;s wife herself after meeting through the organization <a href="http://www.willkommen-in-berlin.de/">Willkommen in Berlin</a>, </em>she told me &#8211; a club for diplomats and their spouses, sponsored by the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The &#8220;Diplo-life&#8221; may be full of constant change and adaptation, but Berlin provides a community just for her type, as I somehow expected it would. <em>Everyone fits</em>, as Hector Sanchez said (or at least many).</p>
<p>As I turned to leave, I made sure to tell Hector that Colombia was no longer just cartels, cocaine, and Hollywood desert in my mind: <em>the food was delicious and exciting &#8211; I love guava!</em>  He seemed pleased, his eyes lightening with pride and appreciation. Delighting in a fresh avocado, picking up grains of pork-soaked rice with finger tips, sipping on guava juice, as if it were the elixir of home: this is how I left Hector Sanchez, culinary talent, and the rest of the Colombian Embassy. I knew, however, that I was not the only one to have fallen in love with Colombian food and two of its best chefs.</p>

<p>Now, don&#8217;t we just wish more embassies would take it upon themselves to allow us momentary homecoming, recreating childhood favorites and bringing people together over a symbolic table, reminiscent of a modern, finger-food Sunday dinner?</p>
<p>Part educational institution, part diplomatic agency, and most importantly, part expat/transnational hub of programming: this should be the new role of embassies, particularly in a city as diverse and adventurous as Berlin. It might just bring more of the locals together with some of its newcomers, uniting over the genius of duck woven into starch, particularly if this duck just happens to be a Berliner.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The Colombian community in Berlin is certainly not all food and drink &#8211; there are organizations which lobby for the kind of &#8216;change&#8217; Hector mentioned, encouraging enhanced human rights and an end to instability and insecurity.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul gives Berlin its baseline. In kind, Berlin is richly integrated into the complexity of Istanbul. For no relationship is ever purely one-sided. And so a Berlin : Istanbul connection, which moves beyond <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/music-germany-migrant-workers-compilation"><em>Gastarbeiter </em>music</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0015359/">Fatih Akin films</a>, is what one can find after six days immersed in the shapes and silhouettes of this city of 13 million.</p>
<div id="attachment_1654" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photogram-20131024120809.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1654" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1654" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photogram-20131024120809.jpg" alt="Photogram-20131024120809" width="620" height="620" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photogram-20131024120809.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photogram-20131024120809-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1654" class="wp-caption-text">Europe meets Asia</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dw.de/turkish-guest-workers-transformed-german-society/a-15489210">guest-worker program between Turkey and Germany</a> is often cited as the beginning of a long-standing socio-cultural and economic relationship, though such ties <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/a-short-history-of-turkish-berlin/">got their start long before</a> the post-war boom period of the 1960s. The &#8216;Turkish factor&#8217;, regardless of how it came to be, makes Berlin, and Germany for that matter, the place we know. Without it, students would miss their late night meaty snack in the likes of Döner, the skyline would miss many of its stunning minarets, and the census would be sorely missing the strength of difference (just to name a few).</p>
<p>But being Turkish, German-Turkish, or Turkish-German in Berlin are states of being <a title="Over and Over" href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/">without a formula</a>. In other words, there is <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/a-short-history-of-turkish-berlin/">more to the Turkish factor than just culinary contributions</a> and street-side renditions of &#8220;<em>walla</em>&#8221; taking place on German soil. There is, in fact, also a &#8216;German factor&#8217; abroad.</p>
<p>Traveling to Istanbul opens up the possibility for a more two-sided conversation, where the German traveler can encounter home and the foreign at the same time, in a place familiar but distant in its urban position. And that is just what we (me and my German companion, Juri) did just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1 in Istanbul: Stammtisch</strong></p>
<p>Upon our arrival into Istanbul&#8217;s (proudly named) Ataturk airport, we were led like lost sheep into the belly of a beast, i.e. Turkey&#8217;s passport control. All around us the air buzzed in German, repeating the ritual of my everyday commute on the metro, this time with the confusion and frustration of a forced queue in a city far away from German-land. A mustached man holding a sign for <em>Studenten der Humboldt Universität</em> (students of Berlin&#8217;s Humboldt University) stood on the other side of the human barrier, shifting his weight methodically. Entering behind us would certainly be this year&#8217;s study trip from <a href="http://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/studiengaenge/masowi/getma">Humboldt University&#8217;s Turkish German Master&#8217;s program</a> in the social sciences, which sends Berliners to Ankara and Istanbul every year.</p>
<p>As we wandered into one bookshop after another on our first evening, it seemed that not only visiting German students would be speaking the language of <em>Sauerbraten</em> and Goethe<i>.</i> Residents of Istanbul are learning <em>Almanca </em>(German), maybe now more than ever.</p>
<div style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_almanca.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" " src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_almanca.jpg" alt="Istanbul_Almanca" width="496" height="496" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">advertisements for German language learning in a bookshop</p></div>
<p><strong>Day 2 in Istanbul: Book Swap</strong></p>
<p>Juri and I stumbled upon a German bookstore on an afternoon of gray and drizzle, just off the pedestrian-friendly thoroughfare of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/14/world/europe/taksim-scenes.html?_r=0">Taksim</a>. Within seconds of walking through quaint double doors, we could hear &#8211; once again &#8211; the language of my daily commute. A young German woman chatted enthusiastically with her father, a yellow Reclam paperback of some German classic in her hand. Her father peered over his narrow reading glasses, raising his eyes just to hit the inventory at the back of the store &#8211; stacks of imported magazines and newspapers, including the kitschy tabloids older women with orange hair read at the bus stops in Berlin.</p>
<p>I wandered to the western edge of the dimly lit shop, discovering 20 ft. high shelves of children&#8217;s books in German. Perhaps kids in Istanbul will also grow up reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippi_Longstocking"><em>Pippi Langstrumpf.</em></a></p>
<div id="attachment_1644" style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_books.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1644" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1644" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_books.jpg" alt="Istanbul_books" width="496" height="496" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_books.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_books-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1644" class="wp-caption-text">German children&#8217;s literature</p></div>
<p><strong>Day 3 in Istanbul: Sharing the Lunch Box</strong></p>
<p>The Germans take their bread seriously, carefully kneading in all kinds of goodies the average American baker might omit out of concern for dental integrity. The so-called Turkish bread one can purchase in Berlin, from <em>Dönerbrot</em> to <em>Milchbrot</em>, has no fit-for-a-squirrel seeds to offer. Enter <em>Vollkornbrot &#8211; </em>your triple whole grain bread &#8211; to be found in your average Istanbul super market. For all the yoga-bending heath nuts in Berlin: this bread is manufactured in Turkey, though ingredients on the package are also translated into German.</p>
<p>And the bread fun doesn&#8217;t stop here. Even the Döner in Istanbul is served in a bun much robuster than Berlin&#8217;s &#8216;Turkish&#8217; prototype.</p>
<div id="attachment_1648" style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_bread.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1648" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1648" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_bread.jpg" alt="Istanbul_bread" width="496" height="496" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_bread.jpg 620w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_bread-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1648" class="wp-caption-text">just your everyday super market</p></div>
<p><strong>Day 4 in Istanbul: The Döner Stories</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The picture of this Döner? No, it wasn&#8217;t taken in Berlin. This dripping lance of assorted protein can be found on the lively streets of Istanbul, where Döner kiosks are visited with as much enthusiasm as in Berlin (so it appeared). There are slight differences in the composition of the sandwich, or shall we say differences in Döner before it became <em>Döner Kebap</em> in Berlin. As the rumor goes, <em>Döner Kebap</em> was invented by a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/4295701/The-man-who-invented-the-doner-kebab-has-died.html">Turkish-German named Mahmut</a>, who happened to serve the traditional vertical meat in a triangular cut of flat bread, instead of in more pita-like Istanbul fashion. The reason, as stated in this same rumor: more bread, so that drunken Berliners might stumble home with saucy meats intact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thirty some years later in Istanbul, meat on a spit can now be received with french fries and fried veggies in that bread package. Berliner style.</p>
<div style="width: 568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_dc3b6ner.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_dc3b6ner.jpg" alt="Istanbul_Döner" width="558" height="558" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">is it lamb? chicken? beef? everything? it&#8217;s Döner.</p></div>
<p><strong>Day 5 in Istanbul: Gimme Some Cake with that Coffee</strong></p>
<p>The German concept of <em>Kaffee und Kuchen</em> (coffee and cake), which inspires the strip of torte-laden cafes in my neighborhood, has made its way to Istanbul in a rich way. Istanbul has its fair share of home-grown sweets, the most delicious ones in fact, involving large amounts of crude honey and nut-laced syrups. Yet, cake with layers of unsweetened cream and a buttery crust, a small apple tart without cinnamon, or a cream-puff styled torte reminds me of my Sunday afternoons devouring Berlin&#8217;s <em>Kuchen</em> culture with friends. And this in the city of the best Baklava I have ever put in my mouth.</p>
<p>In Istanbul&#8217;s trendy harbor-side district, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/mar/22/istanbul-karakoy-top-10-cafes-shops-galleries">Karaköy</a>, we doused ourselves in familiar sugars at a cafe called <a href="http://www.karabatak.com/">Karabatak</a>. A locale where locals in tweed jackets and horn-rimmed glasses slowly sip syrup-sweetened black coffee from delicate (read tiny) French presses. The influence of the Viennese coffee genius and founder Julius Meinl saturates the deco. Dressed up like a Freudian coffee salon, tiles lining the walls, jazzy serenades rolling into &#8216;intellectual&#8217; conversations, one could also be in Berlin&#8217;s Prenzlauer Berg. The extensive magazine selection: <em>Der Spiegel</em>, <em>Marie Claire Deutschland</em>, <em>Vogue Deutschland</em>, dispersed among the newest copy of T<em>he New Yorker</em> and Turkish design magazines. A cosmopolitan coffee date full of Berlin swag and Turkish youngsters.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_cafe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_cafe.jpg?w=640" alt="Istanbul_cafe" width="512" height="682" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Day 6 in Istanbul:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Repeat cosmopolitan coffee date with Berlin swag and Turkish youngsters. For hours and with many forks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Day 7 in Istanbul: What I Know</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We boarded our plane in the dark and found ourselves again in German-land, surrounded by the lucid colors of night and the strangely familiar. The smells that had once been part of a Berlin immigrant cityscape were, after the return, now an experience tied to a place, constitutive of a tangible and pungent cross-continental connection. Two worlds connect. In fact, they were never separated.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We had only heard one side of the conversation.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em><a href="http://www.dw.de/turkish-guest-workers-transformed-german-society/a-15489210">Approximately 3 million residents or citizens of Germany have Turkish background</a>, meaning either they or their parents were born in Turkey, according to the German system of demographic classification. The Turkish population in Germany intensified with the guest-worker agreement between Turkey and Germany, which allowed for the reunification of families four years following the initial agreement, thereby turning the &#8216;guest-worker&#8217; into an immigrant with, in many cases, children. Today, <a href="http://www.dw.de/turkeys-economic-boom-lures-german-workers/a-16873373">more and more Germans (with or without background) are considering a move to Turkey</a>, learning about Turkey, or learning Turkish, reflecting the true nature of a two-sided relationship. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[For those non-Muslims among us, Ramadan is an almost hidden spectacle with mysterious allure: the hot tea, the music, and the platters of food only come out when the sun has turned in for the day or before it has even appeared. We hear the clatter of dishes from our neighbors’ windows late into the night or watch children unpack colorful sweets on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr"><i>Eid al-Fitr</i></a>, all without necessarily being able to place these traditions in our own line of experience. In honor of the last night of Ramadan, here is a reflection on an event Sophia and I attended last Friday as part of Berlin's festival <a href="http://www.piranhakultur.de/event/events_2013/naechte_des_ramadan"><i>die </i></a><i><a href="http://www.piranhakultur.de/event/events_2013/naechte_des_ramadan">Nächte des Ramadan</a>, </i>the Nights of Ramadan...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of the world&#8217;s cities teem with fasting bodies during the c. 30 days of the Muslim holiday of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan_(calendar_month)">Ramadan</a>. About <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/berlinerstatistik/1670484.html">300,000 Muslims</a> live in Berlin: that makes for a lot of hungry individuals during the holy month. Of course, not every Muslim fasts, not every faster is Muslim, and not all Muslims celebrate Ramadan the same (or even at all). But for those non-Muslims among us, Ramadan is an almost hidden spectacle with mysterious allure: the hot tea, the music, and the platters of food that only come out when the sun has turned in for the day or before it has even appeared. We hear the clatter of dishes from our neighbors’ windows late into the night or watch children unpack colorful sweets on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr"><i>Eid al-Fitr</i></a>, all without necessarily being able to place these traditions in our own line of experience. So, what is it actually like to break the fast at the end of the day among friends and family? Among neighbors?</p>
<p>Today is the last day of Ramadan, so it is high time for some reflection on an event Sophia and I attended last Friday as part of Berlin&#8217;s festival <a href="http://www.piranhakultur.de/event/events_2013/naechte_des_ramadan"><i>die </i></a><i><a href="http://www.piranhakultur.de/event/events_2013/naechte_des_ramadan">Nächte des Ramadan</a>, </i>the Nights of Ramadan. Organized by the <a href="http://kreuzbergmuseum.de/index.php?id=1">Kreuzberg Museum</a>, the whole community was invited to an <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/muslime-in-berlin-reim-den-ramadan,10809148,23930332.html"><i>Iftar </i></a>celebration, the nightly breaking of the fast, in the museum&#8217;s garden right near <i>Kottbusser Tor</i>. Of course the breaking of bread in the privacy of one’s home is different from the organization of an intentional <em><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/07/10/whose-multikulti-is-it-the-elusive-definition-of-multiculturalism/">Multikulti</a></em> program. This event was not just about eating and drinking in public after another day doing without: it was about bringing fasting bodies together with the curious non-Muslims or non-fasters among us.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1208" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo.jpg?w=640" alt="photo" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p><i>The gates to the Kreuzberg Museum open to long tables and benches decked with white cloth and table settings. Plates of bloated dates run down the center, stuffed with walnuts, dark chocolate, and coconut.  </i>&#8220;They just put everything in them our bodies might want”,<i> says the small-framed woman across from me with a laugh &#8211; an instructor of </i><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/18/review-become-a-german/">Integrationskurse</a><i>* in Berlin, she tells me. Having fasted and even worked all day, she doesn&#8217;t seem one bit tired, rather concentrated and composed. I am boiling in the midst of what I consider extreme humidity; not a bead of sweat is to be seen on her face which sits surrounded by heavy, sage-green cloth. </i>“You just get used to it, to not eating”,<i> she responds, when I ask if it is difficult, my flashbacks of Lent-related chocolate withdrawal ever-present. </i>“And I can lay down once and a while at work to rest”,<i> she adds. She has been fasting for years, even before she was a practicing Muslim. </i>“I used to fast with my brother, though my parents never participated”.<i> She is originally from Azerbaijan, six years in Germany and still not sure if it’s home. “</i>They are German”,<i> she says pointing to her three friends, “</i>I just live here”<i>. A laugh erupts into the sticky night. She rests her palm on her cheek. </i></p>
<p><i>I find the buffet prepared by (the speaker’s words not mine) </i>die Arabische Frauen<i> (Arab women) and try to take a picture of the overwhelming spread. Ladies in bright colors scurry to assemble more heaps of greasy drumsticks, mounds of semolina and rice with toasted almonds, deep-fried spinach and clumps of rose-colored meat in a breaded dress. </i></p>
<p><i>A small man brings the microphone to his lips  &#8211; not on the stage, but beneath it &#8211; and the prayer begins. It is exactly 9:02pm, and the sun has sunken beneath the city lights. No one dares to nibble on the dates, which is the signal that the fast has been broken. It is silent except for the melodic call to prayer. The teacher from Azerbaijan mouths the words without making a sound, her cheekbones concealed now by the edges of her headscarf</i>. <i>Her head turns downward to fall into her hands forming an invisible Koran in her lap, her palms and their scriptures seeming to capture all sound.</i></p>
<p><i>The three friends of our new teacher-friend return to the table with piles of food, offering us as much as we like, since we will not be getting in line until after those who have fasted. When we protest, the teacher remarks in between slow and measured bites off the chicken bone in her hand,</i> “Your stomach shrinks throughout the day, so your eyes are much bigger than your capacity”. <i>She smiles and points to the mound of food in the middle of our table. Köfte is rolled onto our plates as we politely probe with questions. The three friends are just beginning their 20s, studying at university, active in the </i>organization <a href="http://www.muslimische-jugend.de/">Muslimische Jugend in Deutschland e.V</a><i>. Their involvement in this organization brought them and the teacher together, who seems to smile adoringly but wisely at her younger companions as they speak. None of the three wear </i>hijab; <i>one is engaged to her high school sweetheart and studying to earn her PhD in forensic science. </i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"> <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1207" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo-2.jpg?w=640" alt="photo (2)" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>
<p><i>The director of the Kreuzberg Museum addresses the public – families finished eating though chattering loudly as ever, interested passers-by with backpacks watching the stage, the Kreuzberg Fire Dept. laughing with friends and looking dapper in suits. A small German man in a somber white button-down and black pant, he thanks the neighbors for their patience in tolerating the noise and those neighbors who came to take part, then introduces the musical performance of the night. The Iraqi-German musician <a href="http://www.saif-karomi.com/music.htm">Saif Karomi</a> enters the stage with a beautiful Oud gripped in his right hand. His music, with the accompaniment of a slender wooden flute and a steady Djembe, seeps out into the night. Most of the windows from Kotti’s high-rise apartments are glowing, many left open to let the sounds and the light stream in. </i></p>

<p><i>Trays of dessert circulate the courtyard: pistachio cream with rose water in a honey-soaked pancake </i>(Qatayef);<i> walnuts bathed in honey, chopped, and folded delicately into sweet bread; pistachio and nougat doused in dark chocolate and coconut. Hot tea is served in elegant glasses fit to the palm. Clapping begins in rhythmic compliment to the weeping lull of the Oud. At 11pm the lanterns are extinguished. We head out the gates of the Kreuzberg museum, passing a line of young people smoking on the steps near the sheet of Kebap shops and neon-lit bars. We move on and outward into the other neighborhoods we know well, my body in anything but a state of want.</i></p>

<p>At this event, I kept asking myself what the words &#8220;integration&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; really mean to the politicians who speak them. To me, it is not about &#8220;to each his or her own&#8221; or just about learning the majority language, rather it is about taking part in a two-way process. It is about getting to know one another and forging new spaces of neighborhood between these ways of knowing. It is often just about showing up to our neighbor’s barbecue, about inviting the friendly guy from the <i>Späti</i> to a party, about delivering mail to the lady upstairs (even if she never looks friendly) and staying in a slightly damp hallway to chit-chat (and not because you want to). I have learned from these experiences that it really is just about going to places, interacting with others, and maybe asking questions. Taking an interest in the life and interests of one’s neighbor is an integral part of what it means to live in a metropolis. Any other way forward and things might just fall apart.</p>
<p>Ramadan is one way of holding everything together, keeping us honest in whether or not we really value difference – just like I really value pistachio cream and the Oud, maybe just as much as I value mayo on my fries or the American Diner. Such meet-your-neighbor events also give us reason to congregate and converse about all the things we do not know but might just assume about one another. Not everyone at this event wore <em>hijab</em> or prayed with beads, not everyone fasted, not everyone was Muslim or even the same type of Muslim, for that matter.</p>
<p>It should be of interest to all of us that nearly 7% of Berlin&#8217;s population may be abstaining from food and water in 90 degree heat and 50% humidity, still going to work, driving cars, pushing strollers, running errands, participating in daily life during the holiest days in the Muslim religion. This phenomenon is happening all over the world, times ten, in many different shapes and flavors.</p>
<p>The Kreuzberg Museum holds this event every year. We hope events like it will show up in places less expected than Kreuzberg, maybe even more situated in the everyday. We just have to show up and be a part of it.</p>

<p>*<i>Integrationskurse</i> are federally mandated integration courses for immigrants and refugees within their first three years of residence in Germany. However, these courses have only been in existence since 2005, allowing many earlier waves of immigrants the chance to participate in a combination of language-learning and cultural orientation after the three year period has passed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-564.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-564.jpg?w=300" alt="France and Germany 2013-564" width="630" height="442" /></a>A major benefit of living in a city like Berlin is being able to experience its <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/welcome-to-collidoscope/">collision of cultures</a> on an everyday basis. It&#8217;s not everywhere that I can take the Vietnamese twins I tutor to a British café for tea and scones on Monday followed by breaking the Ramadan fast with my Tunisian friend at her Turkish boyfriend&#8217;s home on Tuesday.  Collision in this sense doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with a clash. <strong>It has everything to do with opportunity</strong>.</p>
<p>Another opportunity I take frequent advantage of is the <em>Thaiwiese</em> or Thai Park around the corner from my apartment building in Wilmersdorf. Coined Berlin&#8217;s &#8220;Little Thailand&#8221;, it&#8217;s a park turned semi-legal market where Thai women have been cooking and selling homemade Southeast Asian specialties under umbrellas for almost two decades. During the summer I&#8217;m here almost every weekend, inhaling shrimp summer rolls slathered in peanut sauce, papaya salad speckled with red chili, and iced coffee swimming in globs of cloyingly sweet condensed milk. I may meander the colorful rows for food, but my coffee always comes from the same umbrella: Kaffee Oma&#8217;s.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-561.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-561.jpg?w=300" alt="France and Germany 2013-561" width="617" height="410" /></a>Kaffee Oma is the self-appointed &#8220;coffee grandma&#8221; and most vocal vendor I&#8217;ve encountered on the <em>Wiese</em>. In what I&#8217;m not sure is a marking of extreme self-confidence or just limited language proficiency, Kaffee Oma almost exclusively refers to herself in the third person in an endearing mix of German and English. &#8220;Kaffee Oma in Berlin since 29 Jahren,&#8221; she tells me when I ask when she moved from Sukhothai, her home town in Thailand. &#8220;Sukhothai, they say it das Ende der Norden&#8221; she explains, pointing to an invisible map in the air.</p>
<p>Kaffee Oma&#8217;s math doesn&#8217;t always add up &#8211; in Berlin for 29 years, retired for 16, working in the Thai Park every day for 23  &#8211; but it&#8217;s all part of her charm. The same charm that elected her park liaison to the <em>Ordnungsamt, </em>Germany&#8217;s most &#8220;German&#8221; of bureaus in charge of order and regulations. Though the vendors don&#8217;t have official licenses, they are allowed to continue their activities under the watchful eye of these dark blue uniformed bureaucrats. Kaffee Oma says she&#8217;s the &#8220;Big Mouth&#8221; of the Park (because what&#8217;s one more self-proclaimed nickname?), regularly sampling the food to maintain quality and organizing meetings with other vendors about pricing and cleaning. You&#8217;ll notice a plate of <em>pad thai</em> will run you the same 5 Euro from one end of the umbrella row to the other. At the end of the day, trash bags are passed out. Not a strip of trash or papaya is to be found come morning.</p>
<div style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-550.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-550.jpg?w=198" alt="France and Germany 2013-550" width="361" height="549" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kaffee Oma</p></div>
<p>There are almost 6,000 Thai nationals living in Berlin, a number that doesn&#8217;t include those of Thai origin who have been naturalized as German citizens. While many Vietnamese were recruited to East Germany during the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s as guest workers by the GDR government, the influx of Thai immigrants mostly began after the Wall came down in the early 1990s. Immigration from Thailand to Germany has been predominantly female, with many initially coming to work as <em>au pairs</em> and nurses. Kaffee Oma is one of many who married a German and made Berlin her home, though she still makes yearly trips back to her other home.</p>
<p>The Thai Park itself has become about more than Berlin&#8217;s Thai community. &#8220;Do a lot of Chinese people come here?&#8221; asked my cousin&#8217;s boyfriend during their visit after recognizing some Mandarin chatter nearby. Before I could properly turn around, I heard English, German, and Thai coming from the same general direction. Everyday the park is rife with nationalities, languages, and multi-ethnic couples and families. The park is not just &#8220;Little Thailand&#8221;: parallel society or ethnic enclave. It&#8217;s an emblem of integration that extends beyond food, beyond Berlin, and even beyond Thailand. A place to enjoy melting pots of culture and curry.</p>
<p>You could go to the Thai Park any weekend &#8211; and I strongly encourage you do so &#8211; but this coming Saturday is particularly special. <strong>The Thai Youth Orchestra &#8211; <a href="http://thaiembassy.de/de/activities-events/activities-news/593-thai-jugendorchester-siam-sinfonietta-am-3-august-im-preussenpark-berlin">Siam Sinfonietta</a> &#8211; will be performing a free open-air concert on August 3 at 18:00.</strong> Come for the music, come for the food, come for Kaffee Oma.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Sophia Burton</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Contrary to popular belief, the Thai Park is open everyday during the warmer months, though the number of vendors does increase greatly on weekends.</em> <em>The park&#8217;s official name is </em>Preußenpark<em> and can be found between U-Fehrbelliner Platz and U-Konstanzerstrasse in Wilmersdorf. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though the skies may be darkened, the streets are not empty, and culinary excursions seem to be the thing to do. I can attest to this fact, as a giant blues-soul-rock montage of musicians are performing &#8217;round the clock on a stage just a few meters from my window as part of <a href="http://www.bergmannstrassenfest-kreuzbergjazzt.de/start.htm">Bergmannstraßenfest</a>. As a loving member of the Kiez, I can tolerate loud tunes and folks my parents&#8217; age sitting on my stoop, drinking mojitos out of plastic cups and chatting loudly about drum-circle politics. Stalls of South Indian fried goodies or Dutch mini pancakes make it hard to be frustrated. And if you can&#8217;t do such things in a Berlin summer, then when?</p>
<p>But if the chance of rain deters participation in any of the street events or outdoor markets this weekend, I&#8217;ve got a solution: stuff your face with delicious Korean-fusion. In fact, why not learn a little about Lauren Lee AKA &#8220;<a href="http://fraeuleinkimchi.com/">Fräulein Kimchi</a>&#8221; &#8211; the proponent of the Korean taco and the Bavarian-Korean cooking course &#8211; whose appearances in Mauerpark and Markthalle 9 are bringing in the masses (even if the retelling of my Bimbibap obsession in my Seattle years elicits more often the &#8220;Bimbi &#8211; whaaa?&#8221; than an affirmative nod).</p>
<p>This post comes from Jessica Jungbauer of <a href="http://www.bestwishesfromberlin.com/">Best Wishes from Berlin</a>, who seeks out the so-called &#8220;creatives&#8221; of the city, the culinary sort among them, initiating short auto-portraits for an interesting lens into one facet of creative engagement or another. This is about Lauren Lee, from Lauren Lee, whose motto says a lot about what is possible in a city that is becoming one blend of unexpected fusions after another: &#8220;part Korean, part American, part German, all Kimchi&#8221;. Happy weekend, eat some kimchi.</p>

<p><em>The day Korean chef Lauren Lee brought some kimchi of hers to Mauerpark in Berlin, she knew that &#8220;Berlin was finally ready for Korean-Fusion food&#8221;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I first visited Berlin during a frosty February in 2006 and fell in love with the city. Considering that I came from Los Angeles and 25 degree weather, that was quite a feat. I decided quite spontaneously to move and 7 months later I landed in Tegel with 2 suitcases, a German-English dictionary and a lot of enthusiasm and naiveté.</p>
<p>What I love about Berlin is that there are still possibilities here as it is a city that is constantly in flux and reinventing itself and it allows me to change and grow with it. The Berlin I experienced 5 years ago when I first moved is quite a different place then the Berlin now and I suspect will be a new place again 5 years from today.</p>
<p>Originally I came to Berlin to study opera with a teacher I had met in New York and a few years ago I was helping to run a fringe opera company &#8211; Berlin International Opera &#8211; while studying and working. Of course I&#8217;ve always loved cooking and entertaining but it wasn&#8217;t until a medical reason forced me to quit singing for a while and I needed a new outlet for my creative energy.</p>
<p>One day I decided to wear one of my dirndls (I have a not so secret obsession with dirndls) and brought some kimchi to Mauerpark. I had a friend photograph people&#8217;s very fun reactions to eating kimchi for the first time and&#8230; voilà, &#8216;Fräulein Kimchi&#8217; was born. I got secretly obsessed with introducing Korean food to all those (poor) people who have had no experience with my native cuisine and whenever I travelled I always had a small package of Korean ingredients with me. (It&#8217;s the best way to get hosted on Couchsurfing if you offer to make people a home-cooked dinner!). I&#8217;ve cooked Korean food and made kimchi for people in Finland, Denmark, Norway, France, Austria, England, Ireland, Italy and of course all throughout Germany. In the meantime, back in Berlin I started teaching cooking classes at one of my favorite foodie stores &#8211; &#8216;Goldhahn &amp; Sampson&#8217; &#8211; and catering small parties and dinners for friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>What always surprises me about Berlin is how much it feels like a small town for being such a large city. I&#8217;ve been lucky in getting to know people through various circles that have really helped me along the way with developing my food passions. I got to know Kavita Meelu through mutual contacts at &#8216;Goldhahn &amp; Sampson&#8217; and cooked for one of her &#8216;Mother&#8217;s Mother&#8217; meals last summer, which then led me to &#8216;Kitchensurfing&#8217; which led me to &#8216;Street Food Thursday&#8217; at the Martkhalle 9, well, I guess I&#8217;ve been blessed with being in the right place at the right time with some amazing people to support me.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m keeping busy with &#8216;Street Food Thursdays&#8217;, my kimchi making and weekly catering at &#8216;Soundcloud&#8217;. I am surprised at how well everything is going, but I guess Berlin is finally ready for Korean-Fusion food and&#8230; Korean Tacos, which has been my passion from the start. It&#8217;s pretty funny, when I first approached the guys at &#8216;Goldhahn &amp; Sampson&#8217; to let me teach my Korean-Mexican class a few years ago, they were fairly resistant to the idea. &#8220;Lauren,&#8221; they said, &#8220;No one will know what that is, what IS a Korean taco?&#8221; I&#8217;m happy to say, I ended up finally convincing them and now I teach my Korean-Bavarian class there as well.</p>
<p>In August I will be starting my own supperclub &#8211; &#8216;Fräulein Kimchi&#8217;s Delish Tisch&#8217;- in Prenzlauer Berg where I will offer seasonal menus with whimsical fusions between Korean, German and American food and I&#8217;m slowly, slowly toying with the idea of a &#8216;Fräulein Kimchi Café&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<p><em>For seat reservations to the &#8216;Delish Tisch&#8217; in August, please contact frauleinkimchi@gmail.com. Be sure to follow the journey of bringing Korean food to Berlin via <a href="https://de-de.facebook.com/FraeuleinKimchikocht">facebook</a> or the <a href="http://fraeuleinkimchi.com/">website</a>.</em></p>
