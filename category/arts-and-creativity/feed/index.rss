										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of Germany&#8217;s World Cup victory, much has been said about a renewed sense of German patriotism and its implications. While some have feared a connection to Germany&#8217;s dark past, others have welcomed the discourse as a chance to shape a new sense of belonging within the country&#8217;s evolving demographics. We&#8217;ve already written something about it <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2014/07/28/world-cup-fever-how-malleable-is-german-identity/">here</a>. But what a discussion on national identity means on the personal level is another story. Or rather many stories. Here&#8217;s one.</p>
<div id="attachment_3184" style="width: 439px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3184" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3184 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ali.jpg" alt="Ali für Deutschland " width="429" height="429" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ali.jpg 429w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ali-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3184" class="wp-caption-text">Ali at the Germany-France game at Train Cocktailbar</p></div>
<p>It took Ali <span class="gD">Riza Gürbüz over 30 years to feel welcome in Germany. Originally from East Anatolia, Ali moved to Berlin at age 12 with his brother and sister. His mother had arrived 8 years prior in 1973 as part of the last wave of guest worker recruitment. She was living in <span class="st">Neukölln and working for a cleaning company</span>. His father stayed behind in Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="gD"><em>The beginning wasn&#8217;t easy</em>, Ali recounts. Understanding German society, learning the language, feeling at home&#8230; this all took time. But eventually he gained his footing, finished his schooling, completed an <em>Ausbildung</em> (apprenticeship), and in 1986, began a career in industrial mechanics. Today, he&#8217;s married, has a 12 year old daughter and an active social life, and makes music in his free time. He still lives in N<span class="st">eukölln. </span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="gD"><strong>But despite spending the majority of his life in Germany, having German citizenship, and making a home here, he&#8217;s often felt like an outsider.</strong> </span></p>
<p><em>I still don&#8217;t really have any German friends</em>, Ali tells me on the last night of Ramadan in July, after breaking the fast together. We&#8217;re sitting outside on Kreuzberg&#8217;s iconic <span class="st"><em>Oranienstraße</em></span> with his friends, also both named Ali, both German-Turks* born in Berlin. Ali and Ali nod their heads in agreement. A rollerblading demonstration passes by in front of us. <em>I don&#8217;t understand it,</em> Ali says. <em>We all have the same sources of stress &#8211; work, money, family &#8211; so why don&#8217;t we make more of an effort to be nice to one another? </em></p>
<div id="attachment_3358" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3358" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3358 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xbergalis-650x473.jpg" alt="Breaking the fast on Oranienstraße" width="650" height="473" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xbergalis-650x473.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xbergalis-300x218.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xbergalis.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3358" class="wp-caption-text">Breaking the fast on Oranienstraße</p></div>
<p><span class="gD">Ali can cite the definitive moment in which he felt that he had finally &#8220;arrived&#8221; in Germany. <em>I was in the Bundeswehrkrankenhaus [German Armed Forces hospital] last December for a week due to a skin issue. I received such kind and affectionate treatment from the nurses and doctors. The same treatment as everyone else. I shared a room with a guy named Wolfgang, and we talked for two days straight, about everything. The atmosphere made me feel really welcome and inspired.</em></span></p>
<p>So inspired, that he started writing a song on his phone while still on his hospital bed. Two days after he was released, he finished &#8220;Ali <span class="st">für</span> Deutschland&#8221; (literally &#8220;Ali for Germany&#8221;), a World Cup song in <span class="gD">support of the </span>German national team. After recording it, Ali ran around to different departments and bureaus in the city, asking for support. Eventually he got a production company to film it for free. The song is available for purchase online (99 cents on iTunes) and half of the proceeds go to a homeless shelter in his neighborhood.<em> I really believed in the song and project, </em>Ali explains, <em>I wanted to show that someone who has my name and looks like me supports the German team. That people from all over the world with different backgrounds live here and consider it their home. </em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Ali <span class="st">für</span> Deutschland Music Video: </strong></p>
<p><iframe width="650" height="366" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mzqz6hCF7uI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Singing alongside Ali in the music video is his daughter. <em>I see that she&#8217;s growing up differently than I did, that she&#8217;s happier. I hope this song contributes to that. </em>For Ali, it all comes back to the media. <em>When Mesut Özil [German-Turkish football player] makes a good play, German-Turkish kids get patted on the back. If he does poorly, people shake their heads at us. The migration background is always emphasized. </em></p>
<p>Ali&#8217;s point is backed by research. <a href="http://www.stern.de/panorama/stern-umfrage-knappe-mehrheit-lehnt-islam-als-teil-deutschlands-ab-2128967.html">A recent Stern poll</a> shows that over half of Germans believe that Islam does not belong in German society. <a href="http://mediendienst-integration.de/artikel/der-islam-gehoert-zu-deutschland-spielhaus.html">Experts</a> argue that Islam is often conflated with Turks, the headscarf, and migration due to images perpetuated in the media. Another common image: German-Turkish or Arab youth as more violent or prone to criminal acts than their &#8220;native&#8221; counterparts, a stereotype repeatedly rebuked by <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/schulspiegel/wissen/kriminalitaet-von-migranten-laut-gutachten-nicht-hoeher-a-983536.html">studies</a>. <em>There are so many positive examples of what German-Turks have done and do for this country</em>, Ali says,<em> but news and social media continuously choose to show negative images. I want the media to show more positive images. </em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Ali is a positive person by nature. His face lights up when he shares stories of making connections to people at work or through his music. But he also has plenty of examples of feeling unwelcome or misunderstood on account of his background. He makes a conscious effort to speak Turkish with his daughter only at home and German out in public, in order to avoid judgment. More than once he&#8217;s been told &#8220;Du bist mein Lieblingst<span class="st">ürke</span><em>&#8221; </em>(&#8220;You&#8217;re my favorite Turk&#8221;), by a coworker or a club bouncer, for not stirring up trouble. <em>What am I supposed to do with that?</em> Ali asks, his eyes filling with emotion. Recently, a colleague joked to Ali that the reason his work contract was not renewed was because of his new hairstyle. <em>You look like a Turk now</em>, he told Ali.</p>
<p>After 6 years at the company, successfully training incoming employees, Ali had expected to keep his job. <em>After the video, they told me my music was making me slower at work, which wasn&#8217;t true,</em> Ali says, shaking his head<em>. <strong>I always felt like they were waiting for me to explode, to show my &#8220;Turkish temper&#8221;. In the end I think they just couldn&#8217;t deal with my humanness.</strong></em></p>
<div id="attachment_3359" style="width: 579px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3359" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3359" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/alitsm.jpg" alt="Performing at a Football Academy Gala, August 2014" width="569" height="335" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/alitsm.jpg 569w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/alitsm-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3359" class="wp-caption-text">Performing at a Football Academy Gala, August 2014</p></div>
<p>Ali is disappointed but not disheartened. He is taking this unexpected turn as a chance to reconsider career paths. <em>I have so much experience, and I want to use that to do something good</em>, he says. He&#8217;s now thinking seriously about becoming a social worker for kids with migration backgrounds. <em>I know </em><em>what they&#8217;re going through.</em> <em>I can go into their homes and talk to their parents, help them see what options they have and make sure they don&#8217;t give up. </em>More than likely, he&#8217;ll do it with music. <em>I learned early on that music allows you to reach a lot of people. Music is its own language, one that you don&#8217;t need to understand, just feel.</em></p>
<p>Ali is certainly &#8220;for&#8221; Germany, but does he consider himself from Germany? <em>Whew,</em> Ali lets out a deep breath, <em>I&#8217;m not sure. I have parts of German culture and parts of Turkish culture. But I think, most of all, I&#8217;m a Berliner.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[International artists in Berlin occupy a semi-privileged position, able to ask critical questions of society without being publicly rebuked. An example of such an artist is Soliman Lawrence. Soli has been photographing the memorialization of Jewish culture in Poland for years, following the tracks of a new form of engagement with the past, as enacted by a more recent generation of Poles. In contrast to Poland, Germany now has its fair share of Jews. What might this mean for memory and its rituals?...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>An interview is never one-sided &#8211; in fact, it is a constructive conversation. I am as much a part of this piece as the artist who answered my questions. Without the contributions of the other, individual statements would hold little significance. So thanks, Soli, for letting me share our conversation. </em></p>
<p>International artists in Berlin are one category of newcomers who, although shaping the cultural politics and economic fabric of Berlin perhaps more than other groups of foreign residents (those without German citizenship), are often left out of the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2014/04/11/integration-in-berlin-research-for-a-desolate-landscape/">critical integration debate</a>. Whether or not they learn German or German constitutional law seems to matter little to the politicians and journalists fueling the heavily institutionalized, assimilating discourse. I have yet to meet an artist who has been pressured by the authorities to &#8216;integrate&#8217; him or herself, as is the case with members of different social and economic groups.</p>
<p>This semi-privileged position has its benefits: Berlin&#8217;s creatives are often able to ask critical questions of society without being publicly rebuked, far enough from local history to recognize nuance and apply cultural critique in a non-threatening fashion.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2684 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-8.jpg?w=640" alt="Jews Poland Klezmer" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-8.jpg 700w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-8-300x200.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-8-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>An example of such an artist is an old friend <a href="http://www.solimanlawrence.com/">Soliman Lawrence</a>. Soli has been photographing the memorialization of Jewish culture in Poland for years, following the tracks of a new form of engagement with the past, as enacted by a more recent generation of Poles. His collection of work is titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.solimanlawrence.com/unquietplacesphoto.html">For those whose faith has been broken</a>&#8220;. They do so, as Soliman&#8217;s stories and their pictures explain, through ritual, one example of which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klezmer">Klezmer</a> music. The fascinating part of this story: there are few Jews to speak of in Poland.</p>
<p>Beyond a revived Klezmer tradition, Soliman photographs reconstructed synagogues, Jewish-themed festivals, hand-made figurines, the maintenance of Jewish cemeteries &#8211; all weaving a tale of things past, now re-born as an ode to matzo ball soup or rabbinical characters.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photo-11.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2681 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photo-11.jpg?w=640" alt="Jews Poland" width="640" height="423" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photo-11.jpg 700w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photo-11-300x198.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photo-11-650x429.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Soliman is not Jewish, though his choice of topic likely gets many thinking that personal biography must inform the interest. I met with Soliman at a little cafe in Neukölln to talk art, history, and memory. Parallels between German memorialization of Jewish culture in Berlin and that which is happening in Poland were not at the tip of his tongue; these parallels were on the tip of mine, however.</p>
<p>Soliman is American by passport, has been a Berlin resident for more than 8 years, making the nationality question a bit tricky. He studied philosophy in the United States, stems originally from the Northern part of Florida, and has a contemplative way about him &#8211; he seems to move slowly, take things in and digest them before forming an opinion.</p>
<p>His artistic career began with a camera, has now evolved into a sort of philosophical exploration of what it means to remember. <em>Memory is at the center of my work</em>, he tells me, <em>how people remember after something has passed, how they remember together</em>. He is interested in the idea of <em><a href="http://www.postmemory.net/">post-memory</a>, the ways in which memory stays alive without the original witnesses</em>. Photography serves a crucial purpose, documentation allowing for connection.</p>
<p>Soliman first started making trips to Poland in 2006, visiting the growing Klezmer festivals in places like Krakaw. <em>Here is the biggest and best festival in Poland</em>, he tells me. I imagine VW buses jammed full with young, alternative Poles, spending warm nights outdoors, not for the beat of electronic sounds but for renditions of clarinet and fiddle. Actually, <em>it is quite mixed</em>, he tells me: young/old, hip/not.</p>
<p><em>When I first showed up in Krakaw, I was taking pictures of everything. I assumed a lot of the stuff I was photographing had something to do with Antisemitism &#8211; graffiti on the walls somehow looked antisemitic to me, these little tiles in the main square with five-pointed stars</em>, <em>for example</em>, he says with a laugh. <em>Then I realized that these stars were actually six-pointed, so </em>not <em>necessarily</em> <em>antisemitic</em>. <em>Very often, one finds what one searches for</em>, I add. This is even more true for a photographer, able to capture and catalog what may be happenstance occurrence, curating images into some sort of narrative about a people or place.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2682 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6.jpg?w=640" alt="Jews Poland Klezmer" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6.jpg 700w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6-300x200.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Antisemitism isn&#8217;t present in Polish society, however: <em>it&#8217;s complicated</em>, he says. An interview with Soliman on Jewish memorial culture in Poland appeared in 2012 in <em>die</em> <i>Zeit Online </i>with the headline: &#8220;<em>Wie Nicht-Juden die jüdische Kultur Polens wiederbeleben/</em> &#8220;<a href="http://www.zeit.de/video/2012-12/2032360755001/holocaust-wie-nicht-juden-die-juedische-kultur-polens-wiederbeleben">How Non-Jews Are Resurrecting Poland&#8217;s Jewish Culture</a>&#8220;. I recall watching the interview then, having heard of the beginnings of his Polish adventures back in 2010, when Soli and I first met, and being struck by the oddity of it all, the sense of a manufactured experience to take the place of an entire culture now lost. And yet, it was impossible not to find parallels with the city we both share, I felt: the way in which memory of Jewish culture in Berlin is fractured between recreations of the diaspora experience, a come-back Jewish culture in Germany, and a newer wave of young Israelis.</p>
<p>Soli has given quite a number of interviews in Germany since his project first began to receive attention. A <a href="http://juedische-woche-dresden.de/veranstaltung-2013/items/108.html">recent exhibition of his work in Dresden</a> put him into more contact with the German media. <em>So, did any of these journalists ask about your thoughts on Jewish memorialization in Germany, in Berlin, or on any similarities between Poland and Germany?</em>, I ask. At first, he doesn&#8217;t understand my question, seems a bit perplexed. Then, <em>No</em>,<em> in fact, no one even got close to formulating that question. Interesting that you bring that up. </em></p>
<p>Jewish culture in Berlin is diffuse, hard to put a finger on, as &#8211; with Jews everywhere &#8211; there is no one way to be Jewish and certainly no one way to be Jewish in Berlin. A memorial culture is also difficult to construct, when Jews are in fact present. To boot, there is no <em>one</em> way to memorialize the Holocaust and the thriving Jewish culture in Germany that preceded it. At least no one way that would satisfy the diverse groups who were affected by the genocide. In Poland, very little has happened at an institutional, top-down level. And so revivals of classic Ashkenazi traditions like Klezmer have been a means of memorializing a lost sector of Polish life, many years after its musicians were made to disappear.</p>
<p><em>At my first Klezmer festival, I didn&#8217;t really know what to do with myself. People were dancing, it was celebratory, there was this feeling of community</em>, he says. He was a bit stand-offish, not understanding why active participation was required. <em>This is the ritual</em>, he explains, <em>it is through such a collective ritual that some form of memory is reconstructed and created for the next generation.</em> <em>Many of these young people probably have no real connection to contemporary Jewish people</em>, he adds,<em> but this type of memory doesn&#8217;t require personal connection, rather an attachment to space and a desire to make a place &#8211; a memorial &#8211; out of it.</em></p>
<p>In Berlin, there is a strong attention to memorial sites or objects &#8211; the <a href="http://www.stolpersteine-berlin.de/en/stolpersteine"><em>Stolpersteine</em></a>, <a href="http://www.holocaust-mahnmal.de/en"><em>Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe</em></a>, <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/touching-berlins-ghosts/"><em>Bayerisches Viertel</em></a>, to name a few. These are spaces that are visited and even organized by many but are perhaps not as interactive or collective as a Klezmer ritual. One might simply pass by its insignia, whereas Klezmer is somehow a more active process, Soli explains.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-9.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2685 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-9.jpg?w=640" alt="Jews Poland Klezmer" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-9.jpg 700w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-9-300x199.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-9-650x432.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><em>But are these Klezmer festivals in Poland really about remembering and mourning the Holocaust? </em>I ask. <em>Yes, it is about that but not only about that.</em> <em>It is about thinking about the Jews that were once here, by people who were too young to have had the chance</em>.</p>
<p>There is a tendency<em> </em>in memorializing activities to focus on objects and their stories; materiality is desired, physical connection reconstructed. The Holocaust documentation and education center where I used to work curated a collection called &#8220;<a href="http://www.wsherc.org/museum/everyday-objects">Everyday Objects</a>&#8220;, the National Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) releases <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/curators-corner">weekly stories online from its archival vault of objects</a>, and even the recent <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sportingscene/2014/04/memory-objects-commemorating-the-boston-marathon-bombings.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Boston Marathon bombings are being actively commemorated through the collection of ordinary things</a>.</p>
<p><em>When talking with journalists, they just don&#8217;t really understand why Klezmer music is so popular in Poland, </em>Soli comments, as if to emphasize the stark differences between the German memory process and that of the Poland he knows:<em> Memory is expressed differently across space.</em> <em>My work is about these different memory ways, memory forms. </em></p>
<p>Surprising to many, Berlin is home to a fair number of Jews, and not just returned German Jews or those that fled from the former Soviet Union, but Israeli Jews, secular Israelis, secular Diaspora Jews from Argentina etc. &#8211; colliding in one city, not necessarily finding community among one another, because why should they? To make the argument, however, that perhaps things aren&#8217;t as different as they seem, I add that one does see a sort of stereotypical Jewish culture in Berlin, from the <a href="http://www.exberliner.com/locations/luigi-zuckermann-deli/">classic deli</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>serving pastrami sandwiches to the local bagel shop. Both places in mind are not run by anyone of Jewish heritage, catering to a historic Jewish culture, perhaps even to New York Jewry rather than Berlin. This is not to say that there are no Jewish delis or bagel shops in Berlin that are owned by Jews. <em>But might the more theatrical recreations be a form of memorial culture, similar to Klezmer festivals?</em> I ask. <em>Maybe</em>, he says, <em>but I know a  few Israelis, and they don&#8217;t necessarily eat bagels. They go to this one shop on </em>Sonnenallee<em> where they can get hummus served warm, like back home in Israel</em>.</p>
<p>The varied layers of Jewish culture, identity, and memory in the Berlin landscape prevent one from making any static comparison to the situation in Poland, it seems &#8211; a place with very few Jews to speak of and a history wrought with a non-institutionalized form of memory, at least until recently. The Israeli and general Jewish presence in Berlin further complicates a comparison between the memory culture of Poland and that of Berlin in a very real sense. To be the authors of a tradition that re-appropriates Jewish tradition means being responsible for potential misappropriation. In Poland, I doubt there are too many active members of the Jewish community who would heavily criticize the rebirth of Klezmer in this form. <em>There aren&#8217;t</em>, Soli says.</p>

<p>If he feels strange about researching this issue as an American artist without Jewish descent &#8211; <em>No</em>. The Holocaust is a large part of how Americans understand Germany, I add, in order validate his work from a place of personal opinion. The past was certainly a key factor in my own interest in contemporary German politics and society, as my <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/25/rave-why-remembering-the-holocaust-is-good-for-immigrants/">article on Sachsenhausen</a> demonstrates.</p>
<p>The question is, if such a connection between a bleak past and curious future can be made, productively, and with much room for nuance and reflection. Soliman Lawrence&#8217;s work allows for just that. Like other artists, he is able to describe memory ways as they are occurring, not overtly criticizing but allowing others to draw their own conclusions or parallels.</p>
<p>We all remember differently. The most important thing is simply to remember.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As a student of my own history and place in this world, nothing is more difficult for me than to write about issues of privilege, white-ness, black-ness, and justice in one sitting, because there is so much that can go wrong, so many terms that can be mis-used or mis-assigned, and so many truths that cannot be conveyed in one text. I have done my best. And with all my socio-anthropological know-how, I may still miss the point or offend, for which I am sorry: so is the nature of the subject.</em></p>
<p>One attends a play about an <em>Afrodeutscher* &#8211; </em>Afro-German &#8211; living in the years of Nazism and Jim Crow not because of the dramaturgy. One buys the ticket because of the topic, i.e. its novelty and near absence in the German discourse. &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221;, &#8220;Made Black&#8221;, at the <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/">English Theatre Berlin</a> explores the rich text of race in 1930s Berlin through the experience of Klaus, an unknowing Afro-German &#8211; a word that still spikes the air with rarity, German-ness still seen by many as a monopoly of the white-skinned.</p>
<p>But Klaus&#8217;s character and his experience of targeted exclusion are not that far from the present, as a conversation with the cast will demonstrate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_4.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht" width="640" height="1016" /></a></p>
<p>The play&#8217;s dense telling of a complicated history of race, citizenship, and post-colonialism through dialogue is impressive. Equally worthy of praise is the playwright&#8217;s collaboration with a well-versed historian.  The Afro-German actor, with a biography startlingly similar to the protagonist he portrays, is also seemingly extraordinary. The most important element, however, relates to its audience and what this means for theater as a medium of cultural critique.</p>
<p>This is not a review of the play, per se, on which the curtains closed this past Sunday. Rather, this is a review of the discussion with the cast, playwright, and director that came after, the sentiments of which will remain prominent and powerful in my mind, long after audience members have discarded their ticket stubs.</p>
<p><strong>The Conversation</strong></p>
<p>Thursday night, we, a primarily white audience, wait patiently for the cast to take their places at the foot of the stage. The protagonist of the play, the actor to play the American jazz musician, the actor to play the German politician, the playwright (Alexander Thomas), and the director file into folding chairs. <strong>&#8220;Black folks probably wouldn&#8217;t go to the theater to see this play in the U.S., let alone have enough money for the ticket. And here, we have a white audience. So, who are we really talking to here? Who is seeing this play?&#8221;</strong>, says the actor who plays the Black American musician &#8211; the play&#8217;s connective thread to Jim Crow.<strong> </strong>The scene seems to agree.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2259" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_3.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht theater cast" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Daniel Brunet, the mustached upstate New Yorker who produces the <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/producing-series/the-lab/">LAB series</a> for the English Theatre and directed this play, chimes in about the lack of representation of certain &#8220;communities&#8221; in cultural institutions. The problem of equitable, fair representation is something sure to resound for both American and German audiences, though certainly in different ways.</p>
<p>This problem is an old one. But it rattles and recalls Berlin&#8217;s more recent debates on multiculturalism, intercultural politics, and the integration &#8211; or just plain tolerance &#8211; of difference. &#8220;The topic of being German <em>and </em>of<em> </em>being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color">person of color</a> (p.o.c.) continues, often with little progress&#8221;, a p.o.c. from the audience remarks, a hint of a German accent in the throat. This topic is contemporary, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Can theater change these parameters? Can theater ask for more diversity from institutions that have no incentive to include them?</strong></p>
<p>The playwright, a Black American married to a white German woman, wrote &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221; as a way to process &#8220;the complexity of these issues&#8221;. And yet, as he makes perfectly clear, representing his own stereotypes of Germans and &#8220;the lack of place in [his] mind for an Other of color in Germany&#8221; is central to the play. &#8220;Otherwise, I would have been acting dishonestly&#8221;, he says, looking into the glare, behind which fragments of the audience, of us, must appear.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the play, himself an Afro-German, speaks, his English flooded with German vowels, his mannerisms oddly similar to his character, who re-asserts his German identity proudly throughout the play in deference to the Othering looks of those around him. This Other, created by the Black American writer, is somehow a reflection of himself, he states, admitting how through rehearsals he struggled to read his lines, even bursting into tears; how the first time he read the play, he felt personally implicated and stripped bare. <strong>&#8220;I am German, my father left when I was three years old, I grew up with my mother, was born in Hamburg, that is all I have ever known”</strong>, he says. The biographies are nearly identical, minus 80 years and a certain regime.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2311.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2255" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2311.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht stage" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The anger he enacts in the play now takes hold of his voice: the desperation and frustration. <strong>“Once I read the script I knew it had to be done, we had to make this play. Though, during intermission, when I was sprawled on the stage in a pile of paper [the stage is composed mainly of bundles and bundles of blank paper], I sometimes thought ‘what am I doing here, who am I talking to&#8217;”</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite these questions of audience and representation, the play successfully sends a message, one of critique. It weaves the complicated history of American segregation and its sub-human treatment of Blacks with the messianic framing of America&#8217;s involvement in WWII. Through the diverse arrangement of its characters, the play scrutinizes American moral authority in the fight against Nazi ideology and fascism, drawing dramatic attention to Jim Crow and the commonalities between racist ideologies.</p>
<p><strong>The parallels between American oppression and Nazi tyranny become painfully clear, eliciting the following question from the audience: &#8220;Would you show this play in America? And under what conditions?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We would just need a theater to show it&#8221;, the playwright says with a smile, confidently speaking for the work alone. &#8220;The play was actually meant for an American audience&#8221;, he adds, hence the translation of German passages and numerous references to American &#8216;race sciences&#8217;, details often omitted from textbooks. &#8220;This is a history of not only segregation but of a science [eugenics and race-based Social Darwinism] that many Americans do not know about&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such a truth of ignorance is reflected in the young woman in the play, who claims that the protagonist, Klaus, is not like &#8220;the other Negroes back home!&#8221;, though she has &#8220;never met one&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2258" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_2.jpg?w=640" alt="colonialism Jim Crow" width="640" height="411" /></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Theater approaches many controversial political topics in the United States, because it can. A very particular demographic is going to the theater; and that is where such issues can be discussed&#8221;</strong>, Brunet adds.</p>
<p>The playwright explains that he is willing to relinquish artistic license and allow others to define the scope and boundaries of the play&#8217;s possible interpretations. Some scenes are based on his own childhood, others on historical research and collaboration with the author of <em><a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/174272/other_germans">Other Germans</a>, </em>Tina M. Campt<em>, </em>about being a person of African heritage in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is the point of the play?&#8221;, the jazz musician asks, perhaps to the audience, perhaps to no one present in this room. It is not about carving out identity from the crowd, asserting the value of the image in the attic mirror, but rather &#8220;about convincing society – the powerful – that exclusion is harmful and degrading to human beings. Now, and back then!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The point is, speaking truth to power&#8221;</strong>, he says, referencing, most notably, <a href="http://www.cornelwest.com/">Dr. Cornel West</a>, a giant in the continued civil rights movement for people of color, for the exploited lower classes.</p>
<p>Theater is not a dialogue with the masses, nor a dialogue with society in general, however. &#8220;Like cultural media and cultural politics, it is a dialogue with the powerful and their ideas&#8221;, says Brunet. The rest is some trickle down effect or, as the p.o.c. from the audience adds, &#8220;a change in consciousness&#8221;.</p>
<p>The camera man, a towering Black man with an equally large voice, speaks to the political or &#8220;transformative nature of the play&#8221;: <strong>“Most people ask themselves the question, are things really that different now? That is what this play does, it asks that question again of the powerful&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">With these words, I instantly feel implicated by my privilege, the things afforded to me on the basis of the position and body I was born into. The room shrinks. I shift in my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We are the audience. We are the ones who should see this play. We shape the discourse, often to the detriment of those who do not fit the desired mold. Theater might be a chance to reflect on <a href="http://www.taz.de/!116745/">critical whiteness</a>, even on its limitations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2296.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2250" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2296.jpg?w=640" alt="English Theatre Berlin" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>One of the members of the cast remarks, perhaps to break a long 15 seconds of silence, <strong>&#8220;Can we imagine a black actor playing Romeo? A white actor playing Othello? Is it bad that we can&#8217;t?&#8221;</strong> For the sake of this question, &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221; should be produced in another season, maybe in another city, as a voice in a room with too few listeners.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that it might be staged in the United States, a country, where diversity often means tolerating the one that is different but disrespecting him or her just the same. As <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/ta-nehisi-coates/">Ta-Nehisi-Coates</a> wrote in <em>The Atlantic</em> this Tuesday, <strong>&#8220;We are in America, where our absence of virtue is presumed, and we must eat disrespect in sight of our sons.<em> </em>And who can be mad in America? Racism is just the wind, here. Racism is but the rain.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p>*After the Nazi dust had cleared the German capital and West German society had taken root, the Black American poet and activist Audrey Lorde began to popularize the term <em>Afrodeutsche(r) </em>or Afro-German,<em> </em>during <a href="http://www.audrelorde-theberlinyears.com/">her years in the city</a>, effectively building a movement that at least gave a name to an almost invisible population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Immigrant integration and identity can be very personal subjects and not everyone wishes for their views and experiences to be made public. Though all the stories in this interview are true, names and some cities have been changed to protect the artist&#8217;s identity, per his request.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_0609.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_0609.jpg?w=640" alt="Admiralbruecke in Kreuzberg" width="604" height="604" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy (<a href="http://www.uberlin.co.uk/stereotypes-different-expats-youll-meet-berlin/">and admittedly amusing</a>) to reduce expats to stereotypes, as if we all neatly fall into one or the other category based on which country we hail from, what we do for a living, or where we party and eat brunch. Reality is always more nuanced and multi-dimensional. Dare we even say, interesting?</p>
<p>Take Alex, American-born artist and documentary filmmaker living in Berlin. On first sight, the dual American-Polish citizen may appear to fit into a few niches: creative type with a studio in <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2014/02/20/lens-an-ode-to-the-maybachufer/">trendy Kreuzberg</a>, one of a rapidly growing number of young <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/07/rant-or-rave-jew-in-a-box/">Jews in Berlin</a>, jetsetter popping between speaking engagements in Europe and gigs in Los Angeles and Seattle. But Alex&#8217;s life in Berlin was more happy accident than predestined by career or background. The idea came from a professor who happened to hear him &#8220;complaining in the hallway about wanting to leave [his homestate] Illinois” and suggested a semester program in Offenbach near Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alex left the U.S. for Germany, and in the past decade, has spent time in Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Karlsruhe. For the past six years he has been Berlin-based.</p>

<p>I meet Alex in his studio on Adalbertstraße, where he shows me some clips of his documentary films and tells me start-ups are starting to take-over former artist space in the building. &#8220;Do you feel integrated?&#8221; I ask later over habanero-spiked food and aguas frescas at Oranienstraße&#8217;s Santa Maria Restaurant. &#8220;You&#8217;re really making me think here,&#8221; Alex ponders, slicing into his pumpkin burrito, &#8220;it&#8217;s a top-heavy question though, isn&#8217;t it? Depends on what you mean by &#8216;integrated&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex isn&#8217;t a fan of dichotomies, the idea that every question always has a right or wrong answer. He prefers to see the world in three dimensions, which he describes as &#8220;the pause in-between inhaling and exhaling&#8221;. Fittingly, by the end of our conversation, he&#8217;s given us three dimensions through which to consider integration.</p>
<p><strong>The Dance Performance</strong></p>
<p>Alex recently attended a dance performance by Wang Ramirez, a pair that works between Berlin, Paris, and London and are &#8220;<a href="http://wangramirez.com/">as diverse as the cultures that clashed and harmonized when its founders met</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“She is ethnically Korean but grew up in Germany, and he grew up in France but has Spanish roots,” Alex explains. &#8220;At one part during the evening&#8217;s program, a woman comes on stage and asks them one of those typical questions about language and identity. How their backgrounds influence their performance and such. Wang and Ramirez respond in a mix of languages and movements, getting progressively more incoherent, to show how essentially absurd and futile that question can be.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/79000095"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-2223" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wangramirez.jpg" alt="wangramirez" width="601" height="335" /></a><br />
<strong>The Jewish Guilt</strong></p>
<p>While attending a conference in Weimar to hear a professor friend of his speak, Alex was approached by a young German student looking for participants in a Jewish identity project.&#8221;He had just found out that he had some Jewish ancestry,&#8221; Alex recounts. &#8220;He wanted to do a photography project on young Jews in Germany to acknowledge this, and asked us if we would participate. Later, when my friend and I were alone and could discuss openly, we realized this project, like so many others, was focused on the past. My friend said, &#8216;why doesn&#8217;t he focus on Germany&#8217;s future instead, as a multicultural country? Perhaps learning Turkish would be a more meaningful contribution.’&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Subway Encounter</strong></p>
<p>One late night on the U-Bahn, Alex found himself among a group of young Turkish-Germans. &#8220;People can&#8217;t usually tell where I&#8217;m from right off the bat. These guys in the U-Bahn asked me. My grandfather was a Sephardic Jew from Beirut, so I just told them I had a Lebanese grandfather and left out the rest. Once they thought I was Arab they started on how they love everyone and all religions&#8230; <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">Muslims</a>, Christians, Jews, etc. Later I wondered how the conversation would have been different if I had said I was Jewish.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aviatorsandacamera.com/travel/nye-art-technology-in-berlin-part-2/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-2224" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn.jpg" alt="berlin u-bahn" width="533" height="397" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn.jpg 259w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Berlin is a great place to come and figure out who you are and what you want to do. It&#8217;s just not the best place to make that happen, funding and opportunity wise,&#8221; Alex explains. &#8220;I always say Berlin is a city full of possibility, but not necessarily potential.&#8221; Alex, like many expats, is not sure what the future holds, other than it being a transnational one. No matter how much opportunity exists on the West Coast, it seems he will always be tied to Germany and, more specifically, Berlin. &#8220;Berlin is a city that breaks my heart,&#8221; he reminisces, &#8220;it broke my heart even before I lived here. Just the thought that a place like this even exists.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/logo_print.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2102 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/logo_print.gif" alt="logo_print" width="207" height="82" /></a>Berlin&#8217;s most famous film festival (<a href="http://www.zeit.de/kultur/film/2014-02/fs-berlinale-festival-stars">George Clooney is here</a>, did you hear?) is not merely a competition for the best cinematography, script, or performance.  Like many other cultural events, politics are at play. For after all, the arts and the judging public are anything but impartial.</p>
<p>The festival of the golden bear invites the local to become a voyeur and thereby, to recall the headlines, the paroles, the debates, the sagas of the last year &#8211; to make meaning of images and thus to make sense of things, or, at least, to just make some sense. In the spirit of the critical viewer and in celebration of themes close to Berlin migration politics, I give you this rave of timely films and the three local contexts that make them and this Berlinale so special.</p>
<p><strong>1. Economic migration, so-called <em><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/armutseinwanderung-viviane-reding-sieht-roma-als-verusacher-a-952308.html">Armutszuwanderung</a>, </em>has captured local and national news as of late. <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/11/20/roma-in-berlin-bureaucracy-in-lichtenberg/">Berlin districts struggle to cope with what they perceive to be an impending crisis of immigrants</a> (read <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/01/happy-weekend-a-roma-reimage/">Roma</a>) from Eastern Europe. Here is a film for that:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20143562.pdf">The Forest is like the Mountains (Pâdurea e ca muntele, vezi?)</a></strong> (Romania, Forum) is a documentary by the German Christiane Schmidt and the Belgian Didier Guillain into the everyday life of a Roma village near the Sfântu Gheorghe district in Romania. Yes, there are tears from a young girl with the admission that &#8220;The Roma [have] never had any money&#8221;. This, however, is not the film&#8217;s baseline. Schlepping materials from the forest basin to the open pastures, pushing horses, playing among the thicket, enjoying the intimacy and stability of family: these elements enrich the plot to something beyond tenuous living conditions. Delivering any image, any experience, of life on the other side of a hyperbolic and vilified form of &#8220;Roma migration&#8221; may help to replace fear and political posturing with understanding. <a href="http://www.berlinale.de/de/programm/berlinale_programm/datenblatt.php?film_id=20143562#tab=video25">Tickets</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-forest-is-like-the-mountains_berlinale_hff-munich.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2096" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-forest-is-like-the-mountains_berlinale_hff-munich.jpg?w=640" alt="The forest is like the mountains Berlinale film on Roma" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-forest-is-like-the-mountains_berlinale_hff-munich.jpg 700w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-forest-is-like-the-mountains_berlinale_hff-munich-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-forest-is-like-the-mountains_berlinale_hff-munich-650x365.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-forest-is-like-the-mountains_berlinale_hff-munich-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. With all the talk of economic crisis &#8211; the <a href="http://www.bildblog.de/tag/pleite-griechen/">disparaging criticism</a> of countries like Greece and Spain for not having managed their households &#8211; it must be difficult for the scores of young Spanish, Greek, Portuguese, and Italian (etc.) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/07/spanish-youth-germany-unemployment-crisis">immigrants coming to Berlin for an underpaid job</a>. Here are some films for that:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.berlinale.de/de/programm/berlinale_programm/datenblatt.php?film_id=20143250#tab=filmStills">At Home (Sto Spiti)</a> </strong>(Greece, Germany, Forum) follows Nadja, a Georgian housekeeper for an upper class Greek family, through a serious illness and the economic crisis that leaves her without a job in a country different from her home. As the catalog describes, Nadja&#8217;s suggested &#8220;misery is not apparent in the images&#8221;. This recalls the nearly invisible damage, which unruly socioeconomic change has inflicted, since the days the &#8220;cr&#8230;.&#8221; word first appeared in print. For countless numbers of workers abroad, from Georgia to Greece, from Madrid to Berlin, the compelling yet un-dramatized portrayal of insecurity elsewhere will resonate with many. <a href="http://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20143250.pdf">Tickets</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sto-spiti_j-m-louis-shnp3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2097" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sto-spiti_j-m-louis-shnp3.jpg?w=640" alt="Sto spiti Berlinale film on migrant worker" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sto-spiti_j-m-louis-shnp3.jpg 700w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sto-spiti_j-m-louis-shnp3-300x200.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sto-spiti_j-m-louis-shnp3-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20142387.pdf">ärtico</a></strong> (Spain, Generation 14 plus) seems like one of many of Spain&#8217;s answers to the statistics plastered in the media: numbers telling of the young, disillusioned, and unemployed (often Spanish). Directed by Gabriel Velázquez, this is a tale of a family struggling to keep all sides intact amid an economic slump that becomes something of its own expectant monster. Youth, accidental parenthood, angst &#8211; all moving into a space of nothing and nowhere to go, in a way that is captivating in its promise of the ordinary. Stills of emptiness and boredom wait for the impending drama that will end it, I would predict. <a href="http://www.berlinale.de/de/programm/berlinale_programm/datenblatt.php?film_id=20142387#tab=video25">Tickets</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/20142387_1_img_543x305.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2098" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/20142387_1_img_543x305.jpg" alt="Berlinale film on Spanish youth" width="543" height="286" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/20142387_1_img_543x305.jpg 543w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/20142387_1_img_543x305-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4. Berlin, in particular, has been both actor and stage for the asylum-seeker debate sweeping Germany, i.e. the <a href="http://www.dw.de/german-neo-nazis-protest-at-refugee-center-in-berlin/a-17037793">Hellersdorf neo-Nazi</a> debacle and <a href="http://www.taz.de/!128096/">unorthodox refugee responses</a> to unpopular policies. &#8220;Asylum&#8221; could thus be the buzzword of Berlin&#8217;s 2013, a word that is both polemical and lacking in biography. Here&#8217;s a film for that:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20143697.pdf">Macondo</a> </strong>(Austria, Competition) sketches the (inter)personal dilemmas of life in a refugee camp on the fringes of Vienna, where 3000 asylum-seekers live closely together, 11-year old Ramasan from Chechnya among them. The reasons for flight are largely unknown to the young boy, other than the narrative of a father fallen to the Russians. Ramasan guards his family&#8217;s honor in the patriarch&#8217;s stead, a visitor arriving to challenge the stability of the narrative and the boy&#8217;s belief. According to the critics, director Sudabeh Mortezai  paints a Muslim childhood under strain, while telling a cliche-free story of flight, waiting, and doubt that might humanize a highly politicized debate. <a href="http://www.berlinale.de/de/programm/berlinale_programm/datenblatt.php?film_id=20143697#tab=filmStills">Tickets</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/freibeuterfilm_macando_berlinale.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2099" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/freibeuterfilm_macando_berlinale.jpg?w=640" alt="Macando Berlinale film on asylum seeker in Berlin" width="640" height="343" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/freibeuterfilm_macando_berlinale.jpg 700w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/freibeuterfilm_macando_berlinale-300x161.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/freibeuterfilm_macando_berlinale-650x349.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1907" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200.jpg" alt="Rixdorfer1200" width="627" height="351" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just come right out with it: It&#8217;s hard to beat Christmas in Germany. <a href="http://www.gluhweinmix.com/whatisgluhwein.htm"><em>Glühwein</em></a>, cookies, classic lights, decorations strewn across homes and street corners, a <a href="http://german.about.com/library/definitions/bldef_cmas0301.htm">calendar</a>that expects, nay, <em>requires </em>you eat a chocolate per day&#8230; it&#8217;s simply wonderful. Though I grew up in the US, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/26/lens-coming-home/">my family</a> celebrated Christmas the Teutonic way. I have more than fond memories of hiding the <em>Buttergebäck</em> and <em>Lebkuchen</em> in the laundry room from our <em>Opa </em>so he wouldn&#8217;t devour them in one sitting, ripping open a human-size <em>Adventskalendar</em> in the course of one night made by our <em>Oma</em>, and relishing the torture of opening presents one-by-one on Christmas Eve under the illuminated <em>Tannenbaum</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/baum.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1909" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/baum.jpg?w=640" alt="baum" width="604" height="604" /></a></p>
<p>The only thing that was missing on our side of the Atlantic &#8211; and perhaps the pinnacle of Germany&#8217;s Christmas genius &#8211; was the <em>Weihnachtsmarkt.</em> The magical, cheerful Christmas market that makes it socially acceptable to go for a <em>Glühwein</em> at lunch with colleagues and eat your weight in candied almonds and those heart-shaped cinnamon cookie necklaces with cheesy phrases on them (ok, no one <em>actually</em> eats the cookie necklaces). The Christmas market that is part amusement park, part shopping center, part bar, part concert, part house of worship. The Christmas market that makes standing outside for hours in winter a desirable activity.</p>
<p>But Christmas markets aren&#8217;t all about empty calories, booze, and decorations. They&#8217;re also not just there for music, gift shopping, and family/friend time. And &#8211; hear me out &#8211; they&#8217;re not just about religion on either end of the purely-Christian-to-overly-PC-spectrum. In its truest sense, a market is a space for community gathering, exchange, and learning. Which is why when I travel, the market is the first place I turn to for an inside look at a different culture and way of life. A Christmas market can be a place for opportunity as much as it is a place for celebration, regardless of religion, background, gender, age, or anything else. And like Kelly wrote this past summer, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">it&#8217;s about showing up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santa.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1912" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santa.jpg?w=640" alt="santa" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Of course Christmas markets come in all shapes and sizes and with varying levels of kitsch and educational potential. In Berlin, there are the <em>über</em>-commercial markets at all major tourists points throughout the city that focus on food and fun: Alexanderplatz, Zoo, Potsdamer Platz. For those who want to class it up a bit, there&#8217;s Gendarmenmarkt and Schloss Charlottenburg. For a smaller-town feel, and if you&#8217;re willing to make the trek outside the <em>Ring</em>, there&#8217;s Spandau. There are even themed markets, like the <a href="http://www.kadre.de/">Designmarket</a> and <a href="http://weihnachten.tagesspiegel.de/schwedischer-weihnachtsbasar.html">Swedish Christmas Market</a>. There is certainly <em>something for everyone</em>, but I&#8217;ve only been to one Christmas market in Berlin that feels truly modern in its <em>inclusion of everyone</em>, and that&#8217;s the Alt-Rixdorfer Market in <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">Neukölln</a>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Funnily enough, the Alt-Rixdorfer market is more about the past than the future. <em>Alt</em> means &#8220;old&#8221; and is a nod to the neighborhood&#8217;s history which is played out with petroleum lighting, young men acting as the &#8220;town crier&#8221; with old-fashioned megaphones, and pony rides. <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/in-search-of-rixdorf/">Rixdorf</a> has a long and proud history as a Protestant bohemian refugee settlement from the 1700s and retains its old-fashioned and quaint feel to this day. Its identity is more that of small village than city neighborhood, especially when juxtaposed with the hustle and bustle of <em>Karl-Marx Strasse </em>around the corner.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1918" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg" alt="rixdorfdouble" width="470" height="597" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg 470w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble-236x300.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>
<p>But besides these touches of years ago, besides the ubiquitous pork products, candied apples, and singing, the Alt-Rixdorfer market offers something different. The stands are primarily run by local clubs, organizations, and charity groups who display and sell homemade wares, whip up international culinary delights, and advocate for their respective causes. And while the market is still predominantly Christian in framework, it&#8217;s not necessarily Christian in purpose. From where I was standing &#8211; bundled up and elbow-to-elbow with young families, Turkish and Arab youth, homosexual couples, a trail of wheelchairs, and my international friends &#8211; the purpose was inclusion, diversity, and participation. Crawling amongst the hoards from stand to stand, I learned about district issues, was served by special needs residents, bought a handmade card with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa"><em>Hamsa</em></a> on it, munched on Korean fried veggies, and watched kids run around proudly to keep the petroleum lights ablaze. What a more meaningful experience than the usual attempt at diversifying such an event: a Dreidel in one corner and Döner stand in the other with everything else green, red, and factory produced inbetween.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inclusion&#8221; is a hot topic these days in Berlin, Germany, and beyond. Yet when it comes to who needs inclusion and where, people and politics tend to focus on &#8220;special needs students&#8221; and &#8220;the school&#8221;. What about the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">open Iftar dinner</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">woman led neighborhood tour</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">public gallery</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/21/lens-warm-nights-are-for-cricket/">baseball field</a>, and Christmas market? These are also shared community spaces that can promote inclusion of all residents through interaction, learning, and participation. The Alt-Rixdorfer Market shows us that a small effort to include the entire neighborhood can not only make cold feel warm and old feel new, but make Christmas about community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight, the performing arts meet Berlin&#8217;s identity crisis. The <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/">English Theatre Berlin</a>&#8216;s new piece by <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/der-neue-der-amerikanische-theatermacher-daniel-brunet-beschaeftigt-sich-ab-dem-15-februar-mit-der/7699722.html">Daniel Brunet</a> asks the hot question, &#8216;Who is a real Berliner?&#8217;. A similar question haunts those moving to big cities everywhere. From that Somewhere-else lying in the sinister boundaries of suburbia to the other city 300 kilometers away with nothing left to talk about, the uncertainty of belonging spikes the air. &#8220;Are you a New Yorker?&#8221; &#8220;Well, I was born here.&#8221; &#8220;Are you a Parisian?&#8221; &#8220;Well, I study here.&#8221; Those people: pretending to be from the &#8216;Bay&#8217; when they are really from Sacramento, CA; pretending to belong to slick air London while knowing only the Midlands; claiming to be one with Mumbai because of a summer spent in its markets. We know those people. We likely belong to them. As a friend of mine asked recently, &#8220;When do I get to call myself a Berliner?&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://static.zitty.de/fm/16/thumbnails/31_24-bu-2_ETB_ECHTER-BERLINER_Foto-by-RodDi-Sciascio.jpg.7573127.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>More often than not, cities divide their residents into the insiders//outsiders, frequently the natives//the foreigners, making the question of &#8216;Who is a real&#8230;&#8217; ever more pertinent. The soundness of the categories doesn&#8217;t matter, just the role they play in validating one group at the expense of another. In Berlin, such dichotomies make things interesting, chaotic, dangerous, tense, and at best &#8211; exciting. They inspire <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/29/prejudice-with-condiments-understanding-schwabenhass/">Nazi-esque graffiti against affluent Southern Germans</a> or fuel <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/09/interview-ali-zoe-and-the-gentrification-debate/">anti-gentrification conflicts that end up turning immigrant against immigrant</a> in the name of hierarchy. But thanks to one strong end of a sociopolitical dichotomy, this city has plenty of outlets for its tensions, i.e. plenty of creative art forms and forums. The tension, however, is one reason the arts have come to be in the first place.</p>
<p>An outlet taking center stage in such debates (excuse the pun) is the theater.</p>
<p>Allow the English Theatre of Berlin to introduce its newest play (or performance piece, according to the theater&#8217;s new <em>stick</em>) pertaining exactly to this dichotomy. &#8216;Echter Berliner!!! Ihr nicht fuck you&#8217; &#8220;is a documentary theater piece exploring the diverging and converging experiences of so-called expats, often coming from comparably richer countries who travel to Berlin for self-realization, with those of so-called immigrants, often coming from comparably poorer countries for financial survival. At least, these are the generalizations (<a href="http://www.etberlin.de/production/echter-berliner-ihr-nicht-fuck-you/">English Theatre Berlin</a>)&#8221;. We know differently, know that the lines are blurred and ink-stained at best, which is why putting them on stage is so brilliantly illustrative, because knowledge doesn&#8217;t always lead to a change of behavior.</p>
<p>This performance is the first segment in &#8216;Aliens of Extraordinary Abilities?&#8217;, a two-part project &#8220;investigating the experiences of so-called expats and so-called immigrants in Berlin and its rapidly changing cityscape&#8221;. The second part, Terrain of Threshold Voices, is a collaboration with <a href="http://www.district-berlin.com/current.php?categorie_id=24">DISTRICT Kunst- und Kulturförderung</a> and set to premiere in November and December.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.etberlin.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ETB_ECHTER-BERLINER__Lynn-Femme4_foto-by-Manuela-Schauerhammer-224x300.jpg" alt="ETB_ECHTER BERLINER__Lynn Femme4_foto by Manuela Schauerhammer" /></p>
<p>In tonight&#8217;s piece, the theatrical result of the community-driven work of six performers hailing from both camps &#8211; the immigrants and the expats &#8211; is a verbatim reproduction of 60 interviews framing the question of belonging in Berlin. Giving vignettes and reflections, avoiding interpretations, the performers themselves &#8211; at once detectives and mirrors &#8211; become, in essence, the messengers of kin. They are charged with the task of representing both so-called community and self in a stream of shadow, prop, and light&#8230;oh right, and performing for an audience.</p>
<p>Challenging the patterns categories afford us and the entitlement longer stays in cities dispense, such a piece (being careful not to boil anything in theater down to a play) is sure to encourage even more dichotomies. At least we have time and creative space to reflect upon them.</p>
<p>For a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcBZ7VnoVVU">theater threatened with closure</a> due to too much devotion to the &#8216;classic play&#8217;, all that comes after the crisis is a surprise and a step in the direction of survival, which may even grant it more courage for controversy.  English Theatre of Berlin, we are watching intently.</p>
<p><em>-by <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Tonight is the last night of the play, but tickets are still available <a href="http://www.reservix.de/off/login_check.php?id=c6ec16e8cf3cd5077514ebef590a1f763d4616b372ef8900411779bf6bedf213&amp;langID=2&amp;vID=10496&amp;eventGrpID=110522&amp;eventID=428332">here</a>! For more information on the theater&#8217;s dramatic threat of closure this past winter, see the <a href="http://www.exberliner.com/culture/stage/save-the-english-theatre/">ExBerliner&#8217;s critical article</a> on the matter and the reader comments it incited. Comments from yours truly are also to be seen. As an active participant in the campaign to save the institution, as a concessions volunteer for the past two years, and as a supporter of the good people who bring art (whether performance piece or classic play) to an international audience, I highly recommend seeing a show here just once. You will be glad you did. Tonight, I am in fact seeing this one and couldn&#8217;t be more excited <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1085152_547637008637523_1494864328_o.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1277 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1085152_547637008637523_1494864328_o.jpg?w=640" alt="1085152_547637008637523_1494864328_o" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re so used to talking all the time that words tend to lose their effect. Especially when the talking is predominantly happening in one direction, as it so often does in immigration discourse. The <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/02/rave-i-am-not-a-terrorist/">Migrantas</a> organization is unleashing an alternate voice within immigrant women in Germany that is arguably just as powerful: their artistic creativity. Simple pencil and paper sketches are transformed into pictograms by the Migrantas artists, then shared with the city on billboards, postcards, and public transit. The finished products don&#8217;t utter a sound but are easily worth more than a thousand words.</p>
<p>This past April, Kelly and I participated in one of a series of <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/02/rave-i-am-not-a-terrorist/">Migrantas workshops</a> in Berlin. Though the two of us pretty much <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/about/">live and breathe immigration</a>, we were surprised how much there was left to reflect upon, namely our own migration experiences. For over two hours, we scribbled alongside five other participants in the very fitting <em>Haus der Kulturen der Welt</em> (House of World Cultures), producing a total of 28 sketches for the artists to work with. Our workshop group was younger than average and also more mobile and privileged: we were all well-educated and, except for Kelly, in possession of the highly-coveted EU passport. But the dynamics of integration go far beyond the legal and political. Economically, linguistically, professionally, socially, personally, even romantically&#8230; in one way or another we were all struggling to feel like insiders.  At the same time, we recognized and celebrated the excitement, enrichment, and fulfillment that accompanies the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/img_3348.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/img_3348.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_3348" width="640" height="368" /></a><strong>&#8220;Migration = Enrichment&#8221;/&#8221;&#8216;<a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/">Migrants&#8217; anyway</a>&#8221; <strong>(despite having a German passport)</strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>This past Friday came the big reveal: we gathered with members of other workshops and the interested public at Berlin&#8217;s <em>Rotes Rathaus</em> for the opening of the exhibit showcasing our work. The exhibit was simple and straightforward, just like the Migrantas concept. A singular stretch of sketches grouped into common themes around accompanying pictograms. No curators, no conjectures, no conclusions. Only an opportunity to see the world through someone else&#8217;s lens and pencil strokes.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-09-20-09-47-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3423" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-09-20-09-47-1-650x650.jpg" alt="2013-08-09-20-09-47-1" width="650" height="650" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-09-20-09-47-1.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-09-20-09-47-1-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The biggest take-away for Kelly and me came in how much in common we seemed to have with children of Turkish guest workers, students from Brazil, and grandmothers from Kurdistan. While our migration contexts, freedom of mobility, and future plans certainly vary drastically, our feelings about the integration process were at times strikingly similar. One group of images showed X&#8217;s over a mouth, a knot in a tongue, a speech bubble filled with jibber-jabber, and the phrase &#8220;I&#8217;m not stupid, I&#8217;m just starting to learn German!&#8221;. Where words may have only shown difference, our sketches revealed connection and commonality, finding themselves side-by-side on the board.</p>

<p>The points of commonality extended beyond those with migration backgrounds, perhaps one of the most valuable but under-appreciated aspects of the work Migrantas does. As one German presenter shared during her welcome speech, images of twisted tongues and closed mouths transported her back to her first experience abroad in Spain with her family and the frustration and fear she felt about not being able to communicate. &#8220;My mother taught me the term <em>no hablo español</em>, and I noticed that the pronoun was missing. I thought she did it on purpose so that it&#8217;d be really clear I couldn&#8217;t speak the language.&#8221; Immigrants or not, these images deliver the compelling message that we are all individuals, we all have multi-faceted identities, and we have all at some point or another felt different. <em>Wir sind das Wir</em>. We are the we.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/12_jorge_prados_beratungstermin_04.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/12_jorge_prados_beratungstermin_04.jpg" alt=" BERATUNGSTERMIN (BEI DER INDUSTRIE-UND HANDELSKAMMER)" width="640" height="360" /></a>No, not you, unless you&#8217;re interested. If so, then it&#8217;s time to sharpen your pencils, place them neatly in one of Germany&#8217;s ubiquitous pencil cases, and get ready to go back to school.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s rewind a bit: <strong>For a long time, Germany refused to acknowledge itself as a &#8220;land of immigration&#8221;.</strong> The bulk of recent immigration came from post-World War II guest worker programs which were initially meant to be temporary, but many migrants stuck around. Their children and children&#8217;s children &#8211; the second and third generations &#8211; were born in Germany but continued to face challenges in regards to integration. They struggled socioeconomically and educationally, lacked German language proficiency, and often lived in parallel societies. In addition, Germany&#8217;s population was aging and fertility rates were declining.</p>
<p>So at the turn of the 21st century, Germany also made a sharp turn where immigration policy was concerned. Integrating &#8220;non-ethnic&#8221; immigrants and their children (and recruiting highly-skilled immigrants) became a priority. A <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/">birthplace citizenship provision</a> was introduced, a national integration plan created, and a &#8220;Federal Commissioner for Migration, Refugees, and Integration&#8221; established. Language became the focal point of integration efforts:<strong> the majority of third country nationals (those from outside of the EU ) are now required to take over 600 hours of state-funded integration courses.</strong></p>
<p>Which brings us back to &#8220;Become a German&#8221; or <em>Werden Sie Deutscher</em>, a new documentary that follows an integration course in Berlin over the course of 10 months. We watch as the class &#8211; whose &#8220;stars&#8221; come from countries like Uruguay, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, and Turkey &#8211; wades its way through simulated spats with neighbors and gay marriage debates in the classroom to real-life job search trials and mundane subway rides.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/start1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-833 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/start1.jpg" alt="start1" width="682" height="381" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/start1-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/start1-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cultural Orientation &#8211; Rules and Behaviors. &#8220;Time is money&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;First work, then play&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>As with any documentary, scenes are cut and pasted together to elicit the most laughs and cringe-worthy moments. Since this is Germany, at least half of the movie zooms in on bureaucracy and rules. <em>You must never</em> <em>throw out an important piece of paper</em>. <em>You must clean up after your dog. You must ride your bike in the right direction of the bike lane, </em>recites a Russian student. <strong>The audience chuckles.</strong> <em>First work, then&#8230; </em>chants the teacher. <strong>The audience groans.</strong> <em>Do you know any examples of German humor?</em> asks the teacher. <em>Uhhh, </em>fumbles the Japanese student. 10 seconds go by. <em>I&#8217;m still thinking, </em>he mutters and scratches his head. <strong>The audience roars.</strong> <em>Please wait outside,</em> instructs a bureaucrat to a family standing outside Berlin&#8217;s <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/24/lens-becoming-foreign-at-the-auslanderbehorde/">foreign resident center</a> in the middle of winter. <strong>The audience gasps. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image-475099-galleryv9-svlk.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-835 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image-475099-galleryv9-svlk.jpg" alt="Film / Werden sie Deutscher" width="640" height="359" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image-475099-galleryv9-svlk.jpg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image-475099-galleryv9-svlk-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image-475099-galleryv9-svlk-650x364.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image-475099-galleryv9-svlk-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The bureaucracy focus is exaggerated, considering that only 45 of the 645 required course hours are delegated to &#8220;orientation&#8221;. Yet, despite how <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/22/lens-becoming-berlinerin-at-the-burgeramt/">ridiculous </a>or boring German bureaucracy may seem, it&#8217;s a necessary system to understand and be able to navigate when living here. Just like regular school, these courses are not all about grades and memorization. They&#8217;re about life skills.</p>
<p>Though far from perfect, these courses are also a commendable effort in giving the newly arrived a fighting chance. The United States proudly waves its &#8220;multiculturalism loving melting pot of immigration&#8221; banner far and wide, but where is its federal office of immigrant integration and state-funded language courses? The adult immigrants I volunteered with in the US came to English class every day after work of entirely their own volition and out of their own pockets.</p>
<p>This film poses a host of larger questions about integration governance: What responsibility do countries have in welcoming newcomers and preparing them for their new society? What should (or shouldn&#8217;t) integration courses be teaching besides language? What does it really mean to be &#8220;integrated&#8221;? It also ignores some important questions: How do courses handle students with varying levels of education and literacy in their native tongues?  <strong>How are regular schools and the media addressing migration to promote intercultural understanding on the side of &#8220;natives&#8221;?</strong> How must German society continue to evolve to truly meet their new-found claim as a &#8220;land of immigration&#8221;?</p>
<p>Integration is, after all, a two-way street. Let&#8217;s just hope we&#8217;re all riding in the right direction.</p>

Get ready for free food, dance performances, calligraphy workshops, language lessons, and interesting tales to this year's theme of "superstition" from the following participating countries: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Bolivia, China, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Iraq, Yemen, Korea, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Nepal, Palestine, South Sudan, Chad, Venezuela (and the Konrad-Adenauer Stiftung). It is no coincidence that many of the countries registered have faced bad press or sweeping generalizations as of late, no coincidence that they are opening their doors and hoping to share something with their neighbors...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>48 Stunden Neukölln may be taking over most calendars this weekend but another event &#8211; one equally worthy of applause  for its focus on cultural engagement with urban space and difference &#8211; is the <a href="http://www.allnationsfestival.de/">All Nations Festival</a>: an open house to many of the city&#8217;s embassies, consulates, and cultural centers.</p>
<p>The theme for this year is &#8220;superstition&#8221;, i.e. the differences between perceptions of what is good or mystical in one culture and bad, scary, even ugly, in another. Think of the practice of shaking hands in one setting, or bowing and refusing a hand in another. Myth and norms surround both exercises of the typical greeting ritual, though we often are not aware of the reasons why such habits exist in the first place, which stories or beliefs surround them. This is one day to find out in action!</p>
<p>An intercultural journey through a <strong>program of free food (eating with hands or seated on the floor is to be expected), dance, martial arts, calligraphy workshops, language sessions, and surprise performances</strong> awaits those ready to hop from site to site with the <a href="http://www.allnationsfestival.de/main/tickets.html">festival&#8217;s passport </a>in hand. These <strong>free passes are available at tourist offices or at participating centers on the day of the event.</strong> For those over-achievers among us, the opening ceremony will be at the <strong>Korean Cultural Center at 11 am</strong>, likely featuring a delicious breakfast as has been the tradition for past festivals (something a bit snazzier than your typical <em>Brötchen</em> smorgasbord, I presume).</p>
<div style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://dsfov63mrkqa8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ANF_2009_Botschaft_von_Sri_Lanka.jpg" alt="ANF_2009_Botschaft_von_Sri_Lanka" width="620" height="465" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sri Lankan Embassy, 2011</p></div>
<p>A downloadable map of all participating locations can be found <a href="http://www.allnationsfestival.de/down/ANF_2013_karte.pdf">here</a>. This year&#8217;s participating countries are as follows: <strong>Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Bolivia, China, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Iraq, Yemen, Korea, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Nepal, Palestine, South Sudan, Chad, Venezuela (and the Konrad-Adenauer Stiftung). </strong>It is no coincidence that many of the countries registered have faced bad press as of late, popular generalizations, or just plain old international misunderstanding. They want to open their doors and share a different lens, open up about what they find scary or good in the world, and do it with their neighbors and co-residents of the city.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>My only question is, where you at United States?! Let it not be forgotten that cultural diplomacy is more powerful than wiretapping one&#8217;s neighbors. At a time when America might just be boiled down to twinkies, Budlight, and the CIA in the media, showing up for an event that supports interculturalism and multiculturalism &#8211; something America is supposed to be &#8220;good&#8221; at &#8211; might not be such a bad idea. But then again, most of the other G-20 countries are no where to be found, so perhaps the message is louder if the room is, well, smaller <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
