										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lichtenberg&#8217;s Dong Xuan Center consists of 6 hangars, stocked tightly with all the things one might come to miss living far away from a place, where a broth of cardamom and ginger is paired with any meat imaginable and the most delicate of noodles; where a certain kind of manufacturing can turn out plastic and fabric wares for all sizes and ages in bulk; where sweet things might come packaged in banana leaves, wrapped around sticky mango rice like presents.</p>
<p>Or this is the impression one might get of Vietnam, when visiting Dong Xuan &#8211; a Mecca in the middle of former East Berlin, little Hanoi amidst not so little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plattenbau">Plattenbauten</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/img_0315.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2159" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/img_0315.jpg?w=640" alt="Dong Xuan Berlin" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>There is no one Vietnamese community in Berlin, just as there is no singular American community of expats. There are diverse and diffuse overlapping relationships, preferences, habits, and often a common language. Being Vietnamese in Berlin is a situation-dependent assortment of elements: oft stigmatized for a generation of non-German speakers and black market-dealers, yet praised for being Tiger mothers and turning out the most successful of <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-kinder-ehemaliger-vietnamesischer-vertragsarbeiter-gehoeren-in-den-schulen-zu-den-besten--ihre-eltern-erwarten-das-auch-bildung-statt-bmw,10810590,10627778.html">Germany’s 2nd or even 1st generation of immigrant young people</a>. For reasons stretching back to the Berlin Wall and the divisions in migration statuses it allowed for, i.e. so-called Eastern <em>Vertragsarbeiter </em>(contract workers) and Western &#8220;boat people&#8221;<em>, </em> there is little unity between traditional East and West.</p>
<p>The <i>Vertragsarbeiter </i>were said to activate <a href="http://www.berlin.de/polizei/kriminalitaet/zigarettenhandel.html">cross-border smuggling of highly taxable goods such as cigarettes</a>, while Western refugees were able to integrate into the official job market more effectively with Bonn&#8217;s pledge of support to communism&#8217;s defectors. In the East, there were Asian fast-food stands with cheap beer on the menu; in the West there were the beginnings of the successful entrepreneurial ventures we enjoy today, such as the 4.90 curry specials in establishments with swanky lighting and signature plates. The successful Dong Xuan Center <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html">was founded by a <em>Vertragsarbeiter</em>, a textile salesman from Potsdam</a>. A blend of both strands seems to be the winning recipe.</p>
<div style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html"><img loading="lazy" class="   " title="Owner, Nguyen van Hien" src="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/image/view/2013/5/19/23446162,20209160,highRes,maxh,480,maxw,480,PON_20130607_111.jpg" alt="founder Dong Xuan Center Berlin" width="320" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Owner, Nguyen van Hien (source: <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p></div>
<p>However, there are stereotypes, and then there are impressions.</p>
<p>A visit to Dong Xuan gives an impression of ambition, of making things happen (finding ways to get exotic fish and fake iPhones into the local marketplace, for example), as well as a sense of mutual back-scratching, as demonstrated by the women carrying trays of soup to fellow merchants or the frequent conversations happening at the register. This place seems founded on a need to reclaim or maintain those connections and goods that had been left behind &#8211; by recreating them.</p>
<p>Walking through Dong Xuan is moving through an extensive network of imports and reconstituted experience. Factory fresh button-downs displayed warehouse-style, synthetic-fibered leggings, and strange plastic toys recreate a Costco journey, minus the samples.</p>

<p>Lichtenberg public officials complain of loitering youth fresh off the plane, mothers abusing the social welfare system on behalf of children fathered by ghost German nationals, or a lack of German language acquisition due to the close-knit nature of the East Berlin Vietnamese. But all of these are broad strokes with a pigment that is in reality quite fractured, diffuse, even elusive.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/lb-integration-migration/statistik/pk_praesentation_afs_bed_bf.pdf?start&amp;ts=1301487082&amp;file=pk_praesentation_afs_bed_bf.pdf">5,000</a> Vietnamese residents of Lichtenberg, making up the largest group of non-German born in the district &#8211; 5,000 out of the <a href="http://www.berlin.de/lb/intmig/statistik/demografie/einwohner_staatsangehoerigkeit.html">13,600</a> Vietnamese in all of Berlin. In Lichtenberg, there is now a <a href="http://www.buergerstiftung-lichtenberg.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=132:deutsch-vietnamesische-kita&amp;catid=60:2013&amp;Itemid=86">Vietnamese-German kindergarten</a>, even Vietnamese books in the local library. A &#8216;<a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stille-community-wie-vietnamesen-in-berlin-leben/8799898.html">silent minority</a>&#8216; it is no more, and more than Dong Xuan it is also.</p>
<p>Slowly, fellow Lichtenberg residents or even those from further afield have come to sit in Dong Xuan&#8217;s “authentic Hanoi street food restaurant” or in the barber chair of a salon full of chatty, pink-nailed women. The slightly kitschy set-up of the part establishment part warehouse compartment suggests the difference between the swanky curries of the West and the raw presentation of this Eastern depot, but it is raw in a way that excites and smells delicious.</p>
<p>As the subheading to an <a href="http://www.zeit.de/2013/11/Dong-Xuan-Vietnam-Berlin">article in the prominent German weekly paper <em>die Zeit</em></a> reads, “Here the Vietnamese sell what they prefer, without worrying about what the Germans might like. But the Germans come anyway to find out what Pho really tastes like, the national soup of Vietnam.” Of course, it is unlikely the Germans put as much chili in their soup as the Vietnamese, or that they enjoy additions such as pig ear, for that matter. But walking through the supermarket, one meets the curious non-Vietnamese shoppers, carefully examining the 25 different kinds of rice noodle for the right density, or those laboriously trying to read the ingredients on the jars of chili paste that line the wall, just beneath a row of meat cleavers and unbelievably heavy woks.</p>
<p>I was one of them, feeling like I was experiencing something similar to Hanoi amidst the oppressively ugly architecture of Berlin&#8217;s residential East, no matter how overwhelming at times. It was like being somehow closer to the Vietnamese in Berlin (or in Lichtenberg, anyhow).</p>
<p>But in the end, there might <em>only</em> be the Viet of Dong Xuan Center, a non-representative micocrosm of what it is like to be Vietnamese in Berlin for its members &#8211; thriving businesses and recreated community. <em>Don Xuan</em>, by the way, means &#8220;prosperous meadow&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.bild.de/geld/wirtschaft/zuwanderung/droht-uns-eine-roma-welle-29296194.bild.htmlhttp://www.bild.de/geld/wirtschaft/zuwanderung/droht-uns-eine-roma-welle-29296194.bild.html">Is a wave of Roma threatening Germany?</a>&#8221; was the recent headline of a popular paper, known for its tabloid-esque reporting. In the Eastern district of Lichtenberg, this headline becomes bureaucracy. In reality, it is about parents, children, and families, who happen to be Roma.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/roma-familie_dokumentationszentrum.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/roma-familie_dokumentationszentrum.jpg?w=640" alt="Roma Familie_Dokumentationszentrum" width="512" height="392" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sintiundroma.de/start.html">Source</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For my fieldwork in sociocultural anthropology, I run from one site of so-called immigrant integration to the next in the Berlin districts of Lichtenberg and Marzahn, doing my best to put together a structure that informs a system of practice. Within the waiting rooms and narrow offices of institutions serving immigrants, Roma are present and obvious, sticking out like a sore thumb without the opportunity for dialogue; they are talked about or talked around. <strong>And so one cannot talk about migration, diversity, and multicultural inclusion in Berlin without talking about how Lichtenberg talks about Roma.</strong></p>
<p>On the first Tuesday of every month, the <em><a href="http://www.migrantenrat.de/">Migrantenrat Lichtenberg</a> </em>(immigrants&#8217; plenary) meets to address issues of migration affecting the district and its neighborhoods. Tables are pushed together to frame a discussion, and the renovated walls of the Lichtenberg city hall fill with urgent  deliberation. The gospel of November&#8217;s session: <strong>The Roma are coming!</strong></p>
<p>At this month&#8217;s plenary, approx. 20 Berliners were in attendance. Based on attire and commentary, bureaucrats from the district employment office (Job Center) and volunteer representatives of  ethnic-cultural organizations of immigrant populations mingled with local political officers. The new district <a href="http://www.berlin.de/ba-lichtenberg/politik/integrationsbeauftragte01.html">commissioner for integration</a>, Bärbel Olhagaray, was presiding &#8211; speaking perfect <em>hochdeutsch, </em>pursing her lips after every third word. But <em>I am married to a Chilean</em>, she remarked in her introduction, one among many reasons why she is an advocate for immigrant integration.</p>
<div id="attachment_1761" style="width: 425px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baerbel.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1761" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1761 " src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baerbel.jpg" alt="baerbel" width="415" height="620" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baerbel.jpg 415w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baerbel-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1761" class="wp-caption-text">Frau Bärbel Olhagaray, Integration Commissioner of Lichtenberg</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.berliner-woche.de/nachrichten/bezirk-lichtenberg/artikel/29620-baerbel-olhagaray-ist-die-neue-beauftragte-fuer-integration-in-lichtenberg/">Source</a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">She offered the opening address, the title of which was &#8216;Roma in Lichtenberg&#8217;. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The speech began with numbers.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Roma number about 800 to 900 in Lichtenberg, though many, many more are to be expected. There are three apartment complexes known to house predominately Roma families in our district, characterized by negligent landlords and overpriced rent. We approached these residences as a reaction to complaints in the area. <strong>Families of 6 occupy 30 square meters for a price of 600 Euros, sleeping nearly shoulder-to-shoulder.</strong> The houses lack consistent ways to dispose of waste. Our priorities are to reinstate order and cleanliness and to visit the families regularly to see what is needed.</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1758" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl.jpg?w=640" alt="Fennpfuhl" width="640" height="382" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl.jpg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl-300x179.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl-650x388.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jeder-qm-du.de/platten-doku/platten-wissen/detail/wbsqp-71-r/">Source</a></p>
<p>But figures and living situations do not matter as much as Euros, at least as policy demonstrates. The economic element of Roma immigration is the primary reason the &#8216;Roma problem&#8217; has gained attention and notoriety, particularly in districts overwhelmed by rumors that may prove to be true.</p>
<p>Since Bulgaria and Romania&#8217;s entrance into the European Union&#8217;s economic area, which allows for the transference of work permission and skills from one member state to the next, only partial admission into the German job market has been granted for citizens from these countries. Citing a wave of unqualified workers, often illiterate, into a strong market-driven economy, i.e. a wave of Roma, this act of exclusion became German federal policy. According to the European Union, Germany was acting in violation of economic rules of engagement and must retract its restricted work policy for immigrants from Bulgaria and Romania at the start of 2014. This affects Roma.</p>
<p><strong><em>Most of the families are registered as self-employed</em>, Mrs. Olhagaray continued, <em>since they do not yet have the full benefits of EU citizenship, which grants them state assistance in many cases of difficulty. </em></strong>They wash windshields at traffic lights, peddle on the U-Bahn, play music in front of the mall entrance and somehow make ends meet.<em> They send most of their kids to school, as far as we are aware, and ensure that they learn German while they are there.</em></p>
<p>When she and her colleagues go by for a visit, she added, they are greeted with open arms, tea, and cake. <em>They know we are there to help them&#8230;and they need our help.</em></p>
<p>The room became silent, waiting for the evident problem to become clear.</p>
<p><strong><em>2014 will be a year of change for Roma in Berlin, primarily for those who have come from Bulgaria and Romania.</em> </strong><em><strong>They will have access to the social welfare system, the situation will change dramatically</strong>, </em>full stop.</p>

<p>Legal change may not change bureaucracy over night. In fact, it may take years until needy families receive any sort of visibility or assistance in the political arena. The <em>Migrantenrat</em> may set the agenda in the community and have an influence on local government, but laws are passed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with assisting Roma in Lichtenberg is the presence of stereotypes, seldom confirmed and often well-spread, evidenced by the contribution of one bureaucrat in employment services. Mrs. Olhagaray listened intently, as the woman &#8211; originally from Bulgaria &#8211; began to describe the situation of &#8216;<em>Zigeuner</em>&#8216; (gypsies), a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/zigeunersossen-streit-interview-mit-silvio-peritore-a-916760.html">word that has since become derogatory</a>, particularly in the culinary world. In a slight Slavic accent, she told of <strong><em>these people: stripping their living quarters of metal and valuable materials for money, over populating neighborhoods, lacking hygiene and order.</em></strong> With one finger pointed out the window at the end of the room:<em> the Pentecostal church, poverty, and illiteracy have led to too many children and no way to care for them!</em></p>
<p>But the cycle is slowly being broken. Many Roma children in Berlin are indeed going to school, and Berlin boasts <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/07/18/rave-education-per-square-kilometer/">initiatives which help them excel, as Sophia profiled back in June.</a> In many countries where Roma have lived before immigrating to Germany, school was not compulsory and in many cases was informally forbidden to them.</p>

<p>It seemed that our task in the <em>Migrantenrat </em>was simply to absorb the fragments of a crisis: the Roma problem unfolding like a heavy, scarlet rug out onto the plenary floor. <strong>Bureaucracy is often about working within the rules set by others, not about solving problems.</strong></p>
<p><em>But why do they come here? Why do the countries where they come from not intervene?</em>, asked a literacy volunteer in Lichtenberg schools, now working to absorb the newly-arrived children of Roma families, who may have never seen a book in their home but <em>come eagerly to learn, nonetheless, </em>she shared.</p>
<p>Without <a href="http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/413-EU-MIDIS_ROMA_EN.pdf">the story of systemic segregation and discrimination</a> behind the Roma (and Sinti) experience in Europe, answering this question is a difficult task. The situation becomes one of economics and not of humanism or even moral action &#8211; something enshrined in Germany&#8217;s constitution under its provisions for asylum and human rights.</p>
<p><em>So, if they can now access social services like any other EU-citizen, how many are expected to come?</em>, asked a representative from the Russian community, his voice lightened by compassion, though cut with a hint of anxiety.</p>
<p><em>Many</em>, was the message, <em>simply thousands</em>. With some other countries <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/opinion/02garcia.html?_r=2&amp;ref=romanipeople&amp;">forcefully rejecting Roma and clearing settlements, as in France</a>, Germany, especially Berlin, will become key destinations in the future.</p>
<p>Fortunately, social work agencies for immigrant populations have developed many projects for Roma-related challenges in Berlin, long before the problem was as acute as it is now. Talking to a <a href="http://www.dicvberlin.caritas.de/">Caritas </a>social worker from my fieldwork, I was told that it was the NGOs and not the government who pushed for <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/18/review-become-a-german/">integration courses</a> to contain a path to literacy. <strong><em>How are they meant to learn German and get a job if they do not know the alphabet, we thought, so we asked for 900 hours of instruction instead of just 600, where they at least have a chance</em>,</strong> she said, exasperated.  <em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Another Caritas colleague was present at the <em>Migrantenrat </em>on this November day.  She sat quietly next to me, taking few notes, her arms crossed. As a social worker with more knowledge of German immigration and employment laws than any bureaucrat I have ever met, she looked a bit frustrated at the shock and awe that surrounding the discussion of a so-called impending crisis.</p>
<p>At the end of the plenary, she turned to me: <strong><em>This problem has been here a long time, we have been telling them&#8230;they didn&#8217;t listen.</em></strong></p>
<p>I turned off my recorder. After reviewing the sound bites from the evening, one thing was clear: Of course, the Roma are coming. Why wouldn&#8217;t they? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrgnkd-Lsl8">Everyone is coming to Berlin.</a> This time, however, these people are not starving artists but rather a persecuted minority, seeking everything they have been denied. Even bureaucrats know that.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p>There is no single <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/01/happy-weekend-a-roma-reimage/">Roma identity</a> or one Roma community, but for starters, some further resources are in order. Roma in Berlin: <a href="http://www.sinti-roma-berlin.de/">Landesverband Deutscher Sinti und Roma Berlin-Brandenburg e.V</a>., the German Roma and Sinti <a href="http://www.sintiundroma.de/start.html">documentation and educational center </a>for current debates and cultural awareness in Heidelberg, the European Union&#8217;s <a href="http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/413-EU-MIDIS_ROMA_EN.pdf">report on discrimination against Roma</a>. Finally, the <a href="http://www.migrantenrat.de/"><em>Migrantenrat Lichtenberg</em></a> is open to the public, if further discussions involving Roma and district politics happen to be of interest.</p>
