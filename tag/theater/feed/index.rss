					<description><![CDATA[One attends a play about an Afro-German living in the years of Nazism and Jim Crow not because of the dramaturgy. One buys the ticket because of the topic's near absence in the German discourse. This is not a review of the play, but rather a continuation of the discussion with the cast that followed. As one of the cast-members remarked, it all comes down to audience: "Black folks probably wouldn't go to the theater to see this play in the U.S., let alone have enough money for the ticket. And here, we have a white audience. So, who are we really talking to here? Who is seeing this play?"...

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As a student of my own history and place in this world, nothing is more difficult for me than to write about issues of privilege, white-ness, black-ness, and justice in one sitting, because there is so much that can go wrong, so many terms that can be mis-used or mis-assigned, and so many truths that cannot be conveyed in one text. I have done my best. And with all my socio-anthropological know-how, I may still miss the point or offend, for which I am sorry: so is the nature of the subject.</em></p>
<p>One attends a play about an <em>Afrodeutscher* &#8211; </em>Afro-German &#8211; living in the years of Nazism and Jim Crow not because of the dramaturgy. One buys the ticket because of the topic, i.e. its novelty and near absence in the German discourse. &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221;, &#8220;Made Black&#8221;, at the <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/">English Theatre Berlin</a> explores the rich text of race in 1930s Berlin through the experience of Klaus, an unknowing Afro-German &#8211; a word that still spikes the air with rarity, German-ness still seen by many as a monopoly of the white-skinned.</p>
<p>But Klaus&#8217;s character and his experience of targeted exclusion are not that far from the present, as a conversation with the cast will demonstrate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_4.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht" width="640" height="1016" /></a></p>
<p>The play&#8217;s dense telling of a complicated history of race, citizenship, and post-colonialism through dialogue is impressive. Equally worthy of praise is the playwright&#8217;s collaboration with a well-versed historian.  The Afro-German actor, with a biography startlingly similar to the protagonist he portrays, is also seemingly extraordinary. The most important element, however, relates to its audience and what this means for theater as a medium of cultural critique.</p>
<p>This is not a review of the play, per se, on which the curtains closed this past Sunday. Rather, this is a review of the discussion with the cast, playwright, and director that came after, the sentiments of which will remain prominent and powerful in my mind, long after audience members have discarded their ticket stubs.</p>
<p><strong>The Conversation</strong></p>
<p>Thursday night, we, a primarily white audience, wait patiently for the cast to take their places at the foot of the stage. The protagonist of the play, the actor to play the American jazz musician, the actor to play the German politician, the playwright (Alexander Thomas), and the director file into folding chairs. <strong>&#8220;Black folks probably wouldn&#8217;t go to the theater to see this play in the U.S., let alone have enough money for the ticket. And here, we have a white audience. So, who are we really talking to here? Who is seeing this play?&#8221;</strong>, says the actor who plays the Black American musician &#8211; the play&#8217;s connective thread to Jim Crow.<strong> </strong>The scene seems to agree.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2259" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_3.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht theater cast" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Daniel Brunet, the mustached upstate New Yorker who produces the <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/producing-series/the-lab/">LAB series</a> for the English Theatre and directed this play, chimes in about the lack of representation of certain &#8220;communities&#8221; in cultural institutions. The problem of equitable, fair representation is something sure to resound for both American and German audiences, though certainly in different ways.</p>
<p>This problem is an old one. But it rattles and recalls Berlin&#8217;s more recent debates on multiculturalism, intercultural politics, and the integration &#8211; or just plain tolerance &#8211; of difference. &#8220;The topic of being German <em>and </em>of<em> </em>being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color">person of color</a> (p.o.c.) continues, often with little progress&#8221;, a p.o.c. from the audience remarks, a hint of a German accent in the throat. This topic is contemporary, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Can theater change these parameters? Can theater ask for more diversity from institutions that have no incentive to include them?</strong></p>
<p>The playwright, a Black American married to a white German woman, wrote &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221; as a way to process &#8220;the complexity of these issues&#8221;. And yet, as he makes perfectly clear, representing his own stereotypes of Germans and &#8220;the lack of place in [his] mind for an Other of color in Germany&#8221; is central to the play. &#8220;Otherwise, I would have been acting dishonestly&#8221;, he says, looking into the glare, behind which fragments of the audience, of us, must appear.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the play, himself an Afro-German, speaks, his English flooded with German vowels, his mannerisms oddly similar to his character, who re-asserts his German identity proudly throughout the play in deference to the Othering looks of those around him. This Other, created by the Black American writer, is somehow a reflection of himself, he states, admitting how through rehearsals he struggled to read his lines, even bursting into tears; how the first time he read the play, he felt personally implicated and stripped bare. <strong>&#8220;I am German, my father left when I was three years old, I grew up with my mother, was born in Hamburg, that is all I have ever known”</strong>, he says. The biographies are nearly identical, minus 80 years and a certain regime.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2311.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2255" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2311.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht stage" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The anger he enacts in the play now takes hold of his voice: the desperation and frustration. <strong>“Once I read the script I knew it had to be done, we had to make this play. Though, during intermission, when I was sprawled on the stage in a pile of paper [the stage is composed mainly of bundles and bundles of blank paper], I sometimes thought ‘what am I doing here, who am I talking to&#8217;”</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite these questions of audience and representation, the play successfully sends a message, one of critique. It weaves the complicated history of American segregation and its sub-human treatment of Blacks with the messianic framing of America&#8217;s involvement in WWII. Through the diverse arrangement of its characters, the play scrutinizes American moral authority in the fight against Nazi ideology and fascism, drawing dramatic attention to Jim Crow and the commonalities between racist ideologies.</p>
<p><strong>The parallels between American oppression and Nazi tyranny become painfully clear, eliciting the following question from the audience: &#8220;Would you show this play in America? And under what conditions?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We would just need a theater to show it&#8221;, the playwright says with a smile, confidently speaking for the work alone. &#8220;The play was actually meant for an American audience&#8221;, he adds, hence the translation of German passages and numerous references to American &#8216;race sciences&#8217;, details often omitted from textbooks. &#8220;This is a history of not only segregation but of a science [eugenics and race-based Social Darwinism] that many Americans do not know about&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such a truth of ignorance is reflected in the young woman in the play, who claims that the protagonist, Klaus, is not like &#8220;the other Negroes back home!&#8221;, though she has &#8220;never met one&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2258" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_2.jpg?w=640" alt="colonialism Jim Crow" width="640" height="411" /></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Theater approaches many controversial political topics in the United States, because it can. A very particular demographic is going to the theater; and that is where such issues can be discussed&#8221;</strong>, Brunet adds.</p>
<p>The playwright explains that he is willing to relinquish artistic license and allow others to define the scope and boundaries of the play&#8217;s possible interpretations. Some scenes are based on his own childhood, others on historical research and collaboration with the author of <em><a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/174272/other_germans">Other Germans</a>, </em>Tina M. Campt<em>, </em>about being a person of African heritage in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is the point of the play?&#8221;, the jazz musician asks, perhaps to the audience, perhaps to no one present in this room. It is not about carving out identity from the crowd, asserting the value of the image in the attic mirror, but rather &#8220;about convincing society – the powerful – that exclusion is harmful and degrading to human beings. Now, and back then!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The point is, speaking truth to power&#8221;</strong>, he says, referencing, most notably, <a href="http://www.cornelwest.com/">Dr. Cornel West</a>, a giant in the continued civil rights movement for people of color, for the exploited lower classes.</p>
<p>Theater is not a dialogue with the masses, nor a dialogue with society in general, however. &#8220;Like cultural media and cultural politics, it is a dialogue with the powerful and their ideas&#8221;, says Brunet. The rest is some trickle down effect or, as the p.o.c. from the audience adds, &#8220;a change in consciousness&#8221;.</p>
<p>The camera man, a towering Black man with an equally large voice, speaks to the political or &#8220;transformative nature of the play&#8221;: <strong>“Most people ask themselves the question, are things really that different now? That is what this play does, it asks that question again of the powerful&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">With these words, I instantly feel implicated by my privilege, the things afforded to me on the basis of the position and body I was born into. The room shrinks. I shift in my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We are the audience. We are the ones who should see this play. We shape the discourse, often to the detriment of those who do not fit the desired mold. Theater might be a chance to reflect on <a href="http://www.taz.de/!116745/">critical whiteness</a>, even on its limitations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2296.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2250" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2296.jpg?w=640" alt="English Theatre Berlin" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>One of the members of the cast remarks, perhaps to break a long 15 seconds of silence, <strong>&#8220;Can we imagine a black actor playing Romeo? A white actor playing Othello? Is it bad that we can&#8217;t?&#8221;</strong> For the sake of this question, &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221; should be produced in another season, maybe in another city, as a voice in a room with too few listeners.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that it might be staged in the United States, a country, where diversity often means tolerating the one that is different but disrespecting him or her just the same. As <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/ta-nehisi-coates/">Ta-Nehisi-Coates</a> wrote in <em>The Atlantic</em> this Tuesday, <strong>&#8220;We are in America, where our absence of virtue is presumed, and we must eat disrespect in sight of our sons.<em> </em>And who can be mad in America? Racism is just the wind, here. Racism is but the rain.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p>*After the Nazi dust had cleared the German capital and West German society had taken root, the Black American poet and activist Audrey Lorde began to popularize the term <em>Afrodeutsche(r) </em>or Afro-German,<em> </em>during <a href="http://www.audrelorde-theberlinyears.com/">her years in the city</a>, effectively building a movement that at least gave a name to an almost invisible population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Immigrant integration and identity can be very personal subjects and not everyone wishes for their views and experiences to be made public. Though all the stories in this interview are true, names and some cities have been changed to protect the artist&#8217;s identity, per his request.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_0609.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_0609.jpg?w=640" alt="Admiralbruecke in Kreuzberg" width="604" height="604" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy (<a href="http://www.uberlin.co.uk/stereotypes-different-expats-youll-meet-berlin/">and admittedly amusing</a>) to reduce expats to stereotypes, as if we all neatly fall into one or the other category based on which country we hail from, what we do for a living, or where we party and eat brunch. Reality is always more nuanced and multi-dimensional. Dare we even say, interesting?</p>
<p>Take Alex, American-born artist and documentary filmmaker living in Berlin. On first sight, the dual American-Polish citizen may appear to fit into a few niches: creative type with a studio in <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2014/02/20/lens-an-ode-to-the-maybachufer/">trendy Kreuzberg</a>, one of a rapidly growing number of young <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/07/rant-or-rave-jew-in-a-box/">Jews in Berlin</a>, jetsetter popping between speaking engagements in Europe and gigs in Los Angeles and Seattle. But Alex&#8217;s life in Berlin was more happy accident than predestined by career or background. The idea came from a professor who happened to hear him &#8220;complaining in the hallway about wanting to leave [his homestate] Illinois” and suggested a semester program in Offenbach near Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alex left the U.S. for Germany, and in the past decade, has spent time in Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Karlsruhe. For the past six years he has been Berlin-based.</p>
<p><a href="http://friedrichshainblog.de/santa-maria-gutes-mexikanisches-restaurant-in-berlin-kreuzberg/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2225" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg.jpg" alt="santa maria in kreuzberg" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg.jpg 600w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I meet Alex in his studio on Adalbertstraße, where he shows me some clips of his documentary films and tells me start-ups are starting to take-over former artist space in the building. &#8220;Do you feel integrated?&#8221; I ask later over habanero-spiked food and aguas frescas at Oranienstraße&#8217;s Santa Maria Restaurant. &#8220;You&#8217;re really making me think here,&#8221; Alex ponders, slicing into his pumpkin burrito, &#8220;it&#8217;s a top-heavy question though, isn&#8217;t it? Depends on what you mean by &#8216;integrated&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex isn&#8217;t a fan of dichotomies, the idea that every question always has a right or wrong answer. He prefers to see the world in three dimensions, which he describes as &#8220;the pause in-between inhaling and exhaling&#8221;. Fittingly, by the end of our conversation, he&#8217;s given us three dimensions through which to consider integration.</p>
<p><strong>The Dance Performance</strong></p>
<p>Alex recently attended a dance performance by Wang Ramirez, a pair that works between Berlin, Paris, and London and are &#8220;<a href="http://wangramirez.com/">as diverse as the cultures that clashed and harmonized when its founders met</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“She is ethnically Korean but grew up in Germany, and he grew up in France but has Spanish roots,” Alex explains. &#8220;At one part during the evening&#8217;s program, a woman comes on stage and asks them one of those typical questions about language and identity. How their backgrounds influence their performance and such. Wang and Ramirez respond in a mix of languages and movements, getting progressively more incoherent, to show how essentially absurd and futile that question can be.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/79000095"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-2223" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wangramirez.jpg" alt="wangramirez" width="601" height="335" /></a><br />
<strong>The Jewish Guilt</strong></p>
<p>While attending a conference in Weimar to hear a professor friend of his speak, Alex was approached by a young German student looking for participants in a Jewish identity project.&#8221;He had just found out that he had some Jewish ancestry,&#8221; Alex recounts. &#8220;He wanted to do a photography project on young Jews in Germany to acknowledge this, and asked us if we would participate. Later, when my friend and I were alone and could discuss openly, we realized this project, like so many others, was focused on the past. My friend said, &#8216;why doesn&#8217;t he focus on Germany&#8217;s future instead, as a multicultural country? Perhaps learning Turkish would be a more meaningful contribution.’&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Subway Encounter</strong></p>
<p>One late night on the U-Bahn, Alex found himself among a group of young Turkish-Germans. &#8220;People can&#8217;t usually tell where I&#8217;m from right off the bat. These guys in the U-Bahn asked me. My grandfather was a Sephardic Jew from Beirut, so I just told them I had a Lebanese grandfather and left out the rest. Once they thought I was Arab they started on how they love everyone and all religions&#8230; <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">Muslims</a>, Christians, Jews, etc. Later I wondered how the conversation would have been different if I had said I was Jewish.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aviatorsandacamera.com/travel/nye-art-technology-in-berlin-part-2/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-2224" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn.jpg" alt="berlin u-bahn" width="533" height="397" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn.jpg 259w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Berlin is a great place to come and figure out who you are and what you want to do. It&#8217;s just not the best place to make that happen, funding and opportunity wise,&#8221; Alex explains. &#8220;I always say Berlin is a city full of possibility, but not necessarily potential.&#8221; Alex, like many expats, is not sure what the future holds, other than it being a transnational one. No matter how much opportunity exists on the West Coast, it seems he will always be tied to Germany and, more specifically, Berlin. &#8220;Berlin is a city that breaks my heart,&#8221; he reminisces, &#8220;it broke my heart even before I lived here. Just the thought that a place like this even exists.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight, the performing arts meet Berlin&#8217;s identity crisis. The <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/">English Theatre Berlin</a>&#8216;s new piece by <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/der-neue-der-amerikanische-theatermacher-daniel-brunet-beschaeftigt-sich-ab-dem-15-februar-mit-der/7699722.html">Daniel Brunet</a> asks the hot question, &#8216;Who is a real Berliner?&#8217;. A similar question haunts those moving to big cities everywhere. From that Somewhere-else lying in the sinister boundaries of suburbia to the other city 300 kilometers away with nothing left to talk about, the uncertainty of belonging spikes the air. &#8220;Are you a New Yorker?&#8221; &#8220;Well, I was born here.&#8221; &#8220;Are you a Parisian?&#8221; &#8220;Well, I study here.&#8221; Those people: pretending to be from the &#8216;Bay&#8217; when they are really from Sacramento, CA; pretending to belong to slick air London while knowing only the Midlands; claiming to be one with Mumbai because of a summer spent in its markets. We know those people. We likely belong to them. As a friend of mine asked recently, &#8220;When do I get to call myself a Berliner?&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://static.zitty.de/fm/16/thumbnails/31_24-bu-2_ETB_ECHTER-BERLINER_Foto-by-RodDi-Sciascio.jpg.7573127.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>More often than not, cities divide their residents into the insiders//outsiders, frequently the natives//the foreigners, making the question of &#8216;Who is a real&#8230;&#8217; ever more pertinent. The soundness of the categories doesn&#8217;t matter, just the role they play in validating one group at the expense of another. In Berlin, such dichotomies make things interesting, chaotic, dangerous, tense, and at best &#8211; exciting. They inspire <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/29/prejudice-with-condiments-understanding-schwabenhass/">Nazi-esque graffiti against affluent Southern Germans</a> or fuel <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/09/interview-ali-zoe-and-the-gentrification-debate/">anti-gentrification conflicts that end up turning immigrant against immigrant</a> in the name of hierarchy. But thanks to one strong end of a sociopolitical dichotomy, this city has plenty of outlets for its tensions, i.e. plenty of creative art forms and forums. The tension, however, is one reason the arts have come to be in the first place.</p>
<p>An outlet taking center stage in such debates (excuse the pun) is the theater.</p>
<p>Allow the English Theatre of Berlin to introduce its newest play (or performance piece, according to the theater&#8217;s new <em>stick</em>) pertaining exactly to this dichotomy. &#8216;Echter Berliner!!! Ihr nicht fuck you&#8217; &#8220;is a documentary theater piece exploring the diverging and converging experiences of so-called expats, often coming from comparably richer countries who travel to Berlin for self-realization, with those of so-called immigrants, often coming from comparably poorer countries for financial survival. At least, these are the generalizations (<a href="http://www.etberlin.de/production/echter-berliner-ihr-nicht-fuck-you/">English Theatre Berlin</a>)&#8221;. We know differently, know that the lines are blurred and ink-stained at best, which is why putting them on stage is so brilliantly illustrative, because knowledge doesn&#8217;t always lead to a change of behavior.</p>
<p>This performance is the first segment in &#8216;Aliens of Extraordinary Abilities?&#8217;, a two-part project &#8220;investigating the experiences of so-called expats and so-called immigrants in Berlin and its rapidly changing cityscape&#8221;. The second part, Terrain of Threshold Voices, is a collaboration with <a href="http://www.district-berlin.com/current.php?categorie_id=24">DISTRICT Kunst- und Kulturförderung</a> and set to premiere in November and December.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.etberlin.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ETB_ECHTER-BERLINER__Lynn-Femme4_foto-by-Manuela-Schauerhammer-224x300.jpg" alt="ETB_ECHTER BERLINER__Lynn Femme4_foto by Manuela Schauerhammer" /></p>
<p>In tonight&#8217;s piece, the theatrical result of the community-driven work of six performers hailing from both camps &#8211; the immigrants and the expats &#8211; is a verbatim reproduction of 60 interviews framing the question of belonging in Berlin. Giving vignettes and reflections, avoiding interpretations, the performers themselves &#8211; at once detectives and mirrors &#8211; become, in essence, the messengers of kin. They are charged with the task of representing both so-called community and self in a stream of shadow, prop, and light&#8230;oh right, and performing for an audience.</p>
<p>Challenging the patterns categories afford us and the entitlement longer stays in cities dispense, such a piece (being careful not to boil anything in theater down to a play) is sure to encourage even more dichotomies. At least we have time and creative space to reflect upon them.</p>
<p>For a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcBZ7VnoVVU">theater threatened with closure</a> due to too much devotion to the &#8216;classic play&#8217;, all that comes after the crisis is a surprise and a step in the direction of survival, which may even grant it more courage for controversy.  English Theatre of Berlin, we are watching intently.</p>

<p><em>Tonight is the last night of the play, but tickets are still available <a href="http://www.reservix.de/off/login_check.php?id=c6ec16e8cf3cd5077514ebef590a1f763d4616b372ef8900411779bf6bedf213&amp;langID=2&amp;vID=10496&amp;eventGrpID=110522&amp;eventID=428332">here</a>! For more information on the theater&#8217;s dramatic threat of closure this past winter, see the <a href="http://www.exberliner.com/culture/stage/save-the-english-theatre/">ExBerliner&#8217;s critical article</a> on the matter and the reader comments it incited. Comments from yours truly are also to be seen. As an active participant in the campaign to save the institution, as a concessions volunteer for the past two years, and as a supporter of the good people who bring art (whether performance piece or classic play) to an international audience, I highly recommend seeing a show here just once. You will be glad you did. Tonight, I am in fact seeing this one and couldn&#8217;t be more excited <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because it is spring, the streets are a bit more bedazzled with color. Be it the bright scoops of Waldmeister ice cream or the gorgeously green chestnut trees that seem to have suddenly appeared, the city is a-blooming. Balls, bikes, and shorts are emerging in kind, which leads quite nicely to this Saturday&#8217;s tip. Surprise, it has nothing to do with good eats but with the stage and, well, the connection between immigration and football (or soccer for the Americans among us).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/esra_rotthoffballhausnaunynstrasse.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-501 alignnone" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/esra_rotthoffballhausnaunynstrasse.jpg" alt="Esra_RotthoffBallhausNaunynstrasse" width="460" height="231" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/esra_rotthoffballhausnaunynstrasse.jpg 460w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/esra_rotthoffballhausnaunynstrasse-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></a></p>
<p>Tonight at <a href="http://www.ballhausnaunynstrasse.de/index.php?id=21&amp;evt=810">Ballhaus Naunynstraße</a>, İmran Ayata und Neco Çelik will present the opening of their newest play, &#8220;<em>Liga der Verdammten</em>&#8221; (League of the Damned), tackling the dynamic configuration of players and fans in Kreuzberg&#8217;s very own &#8220;<em>Multi-Kulti</em>&#8221; football league, <em><a href="http://www.tuerkiyemspor.info/">Türkisempor</a>. </em>Originally formed by Berlin&#8217;s  marginalized &#8216;guest workers&#8217; just 35 years ago, its reputation proceeds it, as do the stereotypes. But &#8220;[it] is not about integration&#8221;, Neco Çelik told <em>die Taz,</em> a daily newspaper,<em> </em>on Thursday. This is the beauty of the play: it is a story about a lifestyle, a community, a sport-culture of roughness and realness in response to societal pressure without intending to play into the trap of &#8216;ethnic&#8217; theater. One could even say that this piece is about the game of making a life after immigration&#8230;or one could say that it is, in fact, JUST about football.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/d567a-566px-257e1.png" alt="" width="204" height="204" />The play premieres tonight, but it runs until 24.05. Each showing begins at 8pm, leaving a few hours between the end of the work day and the stage to kick around a ball, maybe get some green grass on the knees. In springtime, there might be nothing better.</p>
<p>Happy playing or spectating, and of course, happy weekend!</p>

<p><em><em><a href="http://www.tuerkiyemspor.info/">Türkisempor</a></em> might be forced to close its doors, cancelling its season and youth programs due to lack of funds. &#8220;Berlin without Türkisempor is like </em>Wurst<em>without curry&#8221; says it&#8217;s campaign; this might be one statement not worth testing for validity.
