										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lichtenberg&#8217;s Dong Xuan Center consists of 6 hangars, stocked tightly with all the things one might come to miss living far away from a place, where a broth of cardamom and ginger is paired with any meat imaginable and the most delicate of noodles; where a certain kind of manufacturing can turn out plastic and fabric wares for all sizes and ages in bulk; where sweet things might come packaged in banana leaves, wrapped around sticky mango rice like presents.</p>
<p>Or this is the impression one might get of Vietnam, when visiting Dong Xuan &#8211; a Mecca in the middle of former East Berlin, little Hanoi amidst not so little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plattenbau">Plattenbauten</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/img_0315.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2159" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/img_0315.jpg?w=640" alt="Dong Xuan Berlin" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>There is no one Vietnamese community in Berlin, just as there is no singular American community of expats. There are diverse and diffuse overlapping relationships, preferences, habits, and often a common language. Being Vietnamese in Berlin is a situation-dependent assortment of elements: oft stigmatized for a generation of non-German speakers and black market-dealers, yet praised for being Tiger mothers and turning out the most successful of <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-kinder-ehemaliger-vietnamesischer-vertragsarbeiter-gehoeren-in-den-schulen-zu-den-besten--ihre-eltern-erwarten-das-auch-bildung-statt-bmw,10810590,10627778.html">Germany’s 2nd or even 1st generation of immigrant young people</a>. For reasons stretching back to the Berlin Wall and the divisions in migration statuses it allowed for, i.e. so-called Eastern <em>Vertragsarbeiter </em>(contract workers) and Western &#8220;boat people&#8221;<em>, </em> there is little unity between traditional East and West.</p>
<p>The <i>Vertragsarbeiter </i>were said to activate <a href="http://www.berlin.de/polizei/kriminalitaet/zigarettenhandel.html">cross-border smuggling of highly taxable goods such as cigarettes</a>, while Western refugees were able to integrate into the official job market more effectively with Bonn&#8217;s pledge of support to communism&#8217;s defectors. In the East, there were Asian fast-food stands with cheap beer on the menu; in the West there were the beginnings of the successful entrepreneurial ventures we enjoy today, such as the 4.90 curry specials in establishments with swanky lighting and signature plates. The successful Dong Xuan Center <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html">was founded by a <em>Vertragsarbeiter</em>, a textile salesman from Potsdam</a>. A blend of both strands seems to be the winning recipe.</p>
<div style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html"><img loading="lazy" class="   " title="Owner, Nguyen van Hien" src="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/image/view/2013/5/19/23446162,20209160,highRes,maxh,480,maxw,480,PON_20130607_111.jpg" alt="founder Dong Xuan Center Berlin" width="320" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Owner, Nguyen van Hien (source: <a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/chefsessel--asia-town-in-lichtenberg-,10808230,23446150.html">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p></div>
<p>However, there are stereotypes, and then there are impressions.</p>
<p>A visit to Dong Xuan gives an impression of ambition, of making things happen (finding ways to get exotic fish and fake iPhones into the local marketplace, for example), as well as a sense of mutual back-scratching, as demonstrated by the women carrying trays of soup to fellow merchants or the frequent conversations happening at the register. This place seems founded on a need to reclaim or maintain those connections and goods that had been left behind &#8211; by recreating them.</p>
<p>Walking through Dong Xuan is moving through an extensive network of imports and reconstituted experience. Factory fresh button-downs displayed warehouse-style, synthetic-fibered leggings, and strange plastic toys recreate a Costco journey, minus the samples.</p>

<p>Lichtenberg public officials complain of loitering youth fresh off the plane, mothers abusing the social welfare system on behalf of children fathered by ghost German nationals, or a lack of German language acquisition due to the close-knit nature of the East Berlin Vietnamese. But all of these are broad strokes with a pigment that is in reality quite fractured, diffuse, even elusive.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/lb-integration-migration/statistik/pk_praesentation_afs_bed_bf.pdf?start&amp;ts=1301487082&amp;file=pk_praesentation_afs_bed_bf.pdf">5,000</a> Vietnamese residents of Lichtenberg, making up the largest group of non-German born in the district &#8211; 5,000 out of the <a href="http://www.berlin.de/lb/intmig/statistik/demografie/einwohner_staatsangehoerigkeit.html">13,600</a> Vietnamese in all of Berlin. In Lichtenberg, there is now a <a href="http://www.buergerstiftung-lichtenberg.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=132:deutsch-vietnamesische-kita&amp;catid=60:2013&amp;Itemid=86">Vietnamese-German kindergarten</a>, even Vietnamese books in the local library. A &#8216;<a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stille-community-wie-vietnamesen-in-berlin-leben/8799898.html">silent minority</a>&#8216; it is no more, and more than Dong Xuan it is also.</p>
<p>Slowly, fellow Lichtenberg residents or even those from further afield have come to sit in Dong Xuan&#8217;s “authentic Hanoi street food restaurant” or in the barber chair of a salon full of chatty, pink-nailed women. The slightly kitschy set-up of the part establishment part warehouse compartment suggests the difference between the swanky curries of the West and the raw presentation of this Eastern depot, but it is raw in a way that excites and smells delicious.</p>
<p>As the subheading to an <a href="http://www.zeit.de/2013/11/Dong-Xuan-Vietnam-Berlin">article in the prominent German weekly paper <em>die Zeit</em></a> reads, “Here the Vietnamese sell what they prefer, without worrying about what the Germans might like. But the Germans come anyway to find out what Pho really tastes like, the national soup of Vietnam.” Of course, it is unlikely the Germans put as much chili in their soup as the Vietnamese, or that they enjoy additions such as pig ear, for that matter. But walking through the supermarket, one meets the curious non-Vietnamese shoppers, carefully examining the 25 different kinds of rice noodle for the right density, or those laboriously trying to read the ingredients on the jars of chili paste that line the wall, just beneath a row of meat cleavers and unbelievably heavy woks.</p>
<p>I was one of them, feeling like I was experiencing something similar to Hanoi amidst the oppressively ugly architecture of Berlin&#8217;s residential East, no matter how overwhelming at times. It was like being somehow closer to the Vietnamese in Berlin (or in Lichtenberg, anyhow).</p>
<p>But in the end, there might <em>only</em> be the Viet of Dong Xuan Center, a non-representative micocrosm of what it is like to be Vietnamese in Berlin for its members &#8211; thriving businesses and recreated community. <em>Don Xuan</em>, by the way, means &#8220;prosperous meadow&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1907" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200.jpg" alt="Rixdorfer1200" width="627" height="351" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfer1200-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just come right out with it: It&#8217;s hard to beat Christmas in Germany. <a href="http://www.gluhweinmix.com/whatisgluhwein.htm"><em>Glühwein</em></a>, cookies, classic lights, decorations strewn across homes and street corners, a <a href="http://german.about.com/library/definitions/bldef_cmas0301.htm">calendar</a>that expects, nay, <em>requires </em>you eat a chocolate per day&#8230; it&#8217;s simply wonderful. Though I grew up in the US, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/26/lens-coming-home/">my family</a> celebrated Christmas the Teutonic way. I have more than fond memories of hiding the <em>Buttergebäck</em> and <em>Lebkuchen</em> in the laundry room from our <em>Opa </em>so he wouldn&#8217;t devour them in one sitting, ripping open a human-size <em>Adventskalendar</em> in the course of one night made by our <em>Oma</em>, and relishing the torture of opening presents one-by-one on Christmas Eve under the illuminated <em>Tannenbaum</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/baum.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1909" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/baum.jpg?w=640" alt="baum" width="604" height="604" /></a></p>
<p>The only thing that was missing on our side of the Atlantic &#8211; and perhaps the pinnacle of Germany&#8217;s Christmas genius &#8211; was the <em>Weihnachtsmarkt.</em> The magical, cheerful Christmas market that makes it socially acceptable to go for a <em>Glühwein</em> at lunch with colleagues and eat your weight in candied almonds and those heart-shaped cinnamon cookie necklaces with cheesy phrases on them (ok, no one <em>actually</em> eats the cookie necklaces). The Christmas market that is part amusement park, part shopping center, part bar, part concert, part house of worship. The Christmas market that makes standing outside for hours in winter a desirable activity.</p>
<p>But Christmas markets aren&#8217;t all about empty calories, booze, and decorations. They&#8217;re also not just there for music, gift shopping, and family/friend time. And &#8211; hear me out &#8211; they&#8217;re not just about religion on either end of the purely-Christian-to-overly-PC-spectrum. In its truest sense, a market is a space for community gathering, exchange, and learning. Which is why when I travel, the market is the first place I turn to for an inside look at a different culture and way of life. A Christmas market can be a place for opportunity as much as it is a place for celebration, regardless of religion, background, gender, age, or anything else. And like Kelly wrote this past summer, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">it&#8217;s about showing up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santa.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1912" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santa.jpg?w=640" alt="santa" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Of course Christmas markets come in all shapes and sizes and with varying levels of kitsch and educational potential. In Berlin, there are the <em>über</em>-commercial markets at all major tourists points throughout the city that focus on food and fun: Alexanderplatz, Zoo, Potsdamer Platz. For those who want to class it up a bit, there&#8217;s Gendarmenmarkt and Schloss Charlottenburg. For a smaller-town feel, and if you&#8217;re willing to make the trek outside the <em>Ring</em>, there&#8217;s Spandau. There are even themed markets, like the <a href="http://www.kadre.de/">Designmarket</a> and <a href="http://weihnachten.tagesspiegel.de/schwedischer-weihnachtsbasar.html">Swedish Christmas Market</a>. There is certainly <em>something for everyone</em>, but I&#8217;ve only been to one Christmas market in Berlin that feels truly modern in its <em>inclusion of everyone</em>, and that&#8217;s the Alt-Rixdorfer Market in <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">Neukölln</a>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Funnily enough, the Alt-Rixdorfer market is more about the past than the future. <em>Alt</em> means &#8220;old&#8221; and is a nod to the neighborhood&#8217;s history which is played out with petroleum lighting, young men acting as the &#8220;town crier&#8221; with old-fashioned megaphones, and pony rides. <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/in-search-of-rixdorf/">Rixdorf</a> has a long and proud history as a Protestant bohemian refugee settlement from the 1700s and retains its old-fashioned and quaint feel to this day. Its identity is more that of small village than city neighborhood, especially when juxtaposed with the hustle and bustle of <em>Karl-Marx Strasse </em>around the corner.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1918" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg" alt="rixdorfdouble" width="470" height="597" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble.jpg 470w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rixdorfdouble-236x300.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>
<p>But besides these touches of years ago, besides the ubiquitous pork products, candied apples, and singing, the Alt-Rixdorfer market offers something different. The stands are primarily run by local clubs, organizations, and charity groups who display and sell homemade wares, whip up international culinary delights, and advocate for their respective causes. And while the market is still predominantly Christian in framework, it&#8217;s not necessarily Christian in purpose. From where I was standing &#8211; bundled up and elbow-to-elbow with young families, Turkish and Arab youth, homosexual couples, a trail of wheelchairs, and my international friends &#8211; the purpose was inclusion, diversity, and participation. Crawling amongst the hoards from stand to stand, I learned about district issues, was served by special needs residents, bought a handmade card with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa"><em>Hamsa</em></a> on it, munched on Korean fried veggies, and watched kids run around proudly to keep the petroleum lights ablaze. What a more meaningful experience than the usual attempt at diversifying such an event: a Dreidel in one corner and Döner stand in the other with everything else green, red, and factory produced inbetween.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inclusion&#8221; is a hot topic these days in Berlin, Germany, and beyond. Yet when it comes to who needs inclusion and where, people and politics tend to focus on &#8220;special needs students&#8221; and &#8220;the school&#8221;. What about the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">open Iftar dinner</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">woman led neighborhood tour</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/27/rave-neukollns-intercultural-day-to-day/">public gallery</a>, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/21/lens-warm-nights-are-for-cricket/">baseball field</a>, and Christmas market? These are also shared community spaces that can promote inclusion of all residents through interaction, learning, and participation. The Alt-Rixdorfer Market shows us that a small effort to include the entire neighborhood can not only make cold feel warm and old feel new, but make Christmas about community.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What role do embassies play in the lives of foreign nationals abroad? Beyond pure administration and diplomacy, cultural events that allow for a homecoming, a return to childhood, and a bringing together of compatriots might change how immigrants and expats live abroad and the involvement of embassies and consulates therein.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1874" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg?w=640" alt="columbia" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia-300x200.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>What role do embassies play in the lives of foreign nationals abroad? Many of us living in a country for which we do not possess a passport are likely to associate our local embassy with administrative assistance, i.e. replacing documents needed to prove our identity and belonging in the international system. In many public discussions of transnationalism and cosmopolitanism, the nation-state can take on an equally administrative face. <em>It&#8217;s all about technology, no longer about borders or space; the world is post-modern, and so is identity.</em></p>
<p>As the anthropologist <a href="http://www.arjunappadurai.org/">Arjun Appadurai </a>preached in the 1990s, human societies are experiencing a &#8216;deterritorialization&#8217;, making the nation-state less and less relevant for our real lives, its relevance relegated to the small tasks we rely on for bureaucratic systems to function properly.</p>
<p>But it is <em>not </em>this black and white. For those of us who have lived apart from all that was <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/16/lens-going-away/">once familiar and full of memory</a> for a period longer than the term &#8216;abroad&#8217; can afford, the food &#8211; most importantly &#8211; of the former territory of &#8216;home&#8217; becomes something we long for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_fried-plantains.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1875" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_fried-plantains.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_fried plantains" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>And so this rave asks a simple question: What if (nation-)states and their representative institutions abroad played both a symbolic and tangible role in the lives of immigrants holding passports from these places?</p>
<p>There happens to be an example for such, namely the Embassy of Colombia in Germany and its recent culinary festival:</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Sophia and I were invited to this special event, meant to recreate the flavors of many a Colombian childhood in a chic Neukölln space for foodies &#8211; <a href="http://www.feinschlicht.de/">Manufaktur Feinschlicht</a> &#8211; complete with a charming Ambassador and homesick interns. The event was the backdrop to the presentation of a cook book straight out of the homeland, entitled <em>Colombia, Cooking by Regions</em> by Maria Lía Neira Restrepo. With a  full culinary program, using ingredients one can find here in Germany, two worlds were forged on a brisk Berlin evening. This union meant homecoming for some and travel for others.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_candles-table.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1880" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_candles-table.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Candles table" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Renowned chef <a href="http://www.restaurantedianagarcia.com/home.html">Diana Garcia</a>, featured in <em>Colombia, Cooking by Regions</em>, was flown out to Berlin for the event, along with pal, chef Magda Hamon. The two women brought decades of experience, a power house of flavor, and the openness and friendly encounter akin to a family Sunday dinner (for those of us that remember those).</p>
<p>The women were paired with two German chefs &#8211; both looking a bit like they should be flinging fish at Pike Place Market, rather than managing finger foods. In minutes the kitchen and serving foyer were a buzz with the good vibes of cross-cultural collaboration. The Germans, Kai and Robert, filleted brined salmon with rough hands, delicately arranging plates of plantain-based crostini, while the two Colombian ladies tended large cuts of pork belly and whisked various sauces to life in the kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1877" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg?w=640" alt="colombian-embassy-party-001 embassy deriv" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p>The chefs delivered the beautifully-presented treats to the guests themselves, wandering through the room in white coats, making eye contact with eager mouths, answering questions about ingredients and origin, making all feel welcome to partake in something, well, just great and gluttonous.</p>
<p>Glorifying both the Berlin environs and Colombian roots, it was easy to relate to the enthusiasm and personal connection to the dishes that seemed obvious through taste and composition.</p>
<p>10 waves of savory bites passed through the intimate space where we all gathered around the bar, which never failed to serve up rows of guava-rum puree, delicate glasses of Prosecco, and bottles of rich Colombian wine (both red <em>and </em>white, and both delicious). Surrounded by the chutneys and other jarred creations of <a href="http://www.feinschlicht.de/">Manufaktur Feinschlicht</a>, the ever-increasing guests eyed the prep table and the hall to the kitchen, anxiously awaiting the rolling arrival of new platters and, above all, the kind-eyed and wide-smiled chefs.</p>
<p><em>Colombia is a country of flowers and fruits &#8211; we hope you will taste that! We also love meat, </em>Diana Garcia told the crowd, beaming and laughing a bit in the face of so many cameras.</p>
<p>Pork belly in a muddy water sauce with Berlin&#8217;s (happy) <em>Schwein</em>; fried plantain with a cheese crust; <em>lox</em> on potato-pillows with a healthy dollop of guacamole; breaded and seared scallops on coconut rice (the coconut hailing from the coastal region of Colombia, according to the chefs); creme de leche in pieces big enough to give the teeth something to work on; a creamy pudding enveloping local fruits and Colombian flowers; <em>Currywurst</em> with a bit of guava in the sauce; duck rice with a Berlin-grown bird: all with both decadence and simplicity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_scallop.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1876" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_scallop.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Scallop" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>The young Colombians around me, most of them with positions at the embassy or friends with such coveted diplomatic jobs, celebrated every dish, every reference to summers on the coast, to lunches with grandma, to the country&#8217;s everyday bounty becoming so special through distance.</p>
<p><em>Guava, milk pudding: my favorite things! </em>Hector Sanchez, one of the embassy interns told me, after I openly praised the addition of guava to everything forever and ever. He has <em>been away from Colombia for longer than ever</em>, was studying in Geneva before coming to Berlin, and will be in Berlin for at least one year. <em>I enjoy Berlin because here, everyone fits,</em> even the Colombians. <em>Here I can relax and feel at home</em>, he said, eyeing the second round of <em>Chicharrones</em> and speaking a few adoring words to the room and the chef, the crunchy skin sliding into his mouth.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_hector.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1878" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_hector.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Hector" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>When I asked if it is easy to recreate these Colombian flavors in Berlin &#8211; <em>I have heard that there is a Colombian food store in Mehringdamm, but I&#8217;ve never been there. </em>I couldn&#8217;t seem to find it either. Jaggery, fresh sugar cane, or guava punch are ever elusive, it seems. We talked about the role of the embassy, how such institutions are charged with many often symbolic tasks, such as this one. But it isn&#8217;t symbolic, <em>it reminds me of home</em>, he added.</p>
<p>And so, <em>What do you want Germans to know about Colombia, about Colombians?, </em>I asked, really having no anticipated answer to this question, which is rare, when I choose to ask one. <em>I want them to know that Colombia is changing. It used to be dangerous, but things are getting better. Change, Change! </em>I mentioned that many associate Colombia with films about drug cartels trucking cocaine across the desert in military fatigues. <em>In Bogota it is cold, like 18 degrees all the time and is at a high elevation! And the coastal region is beautiful and where many of these foods come from. You don&#8217;t see that in the</em> <em>movies</em>, he added, a bit flustered. <em> </em></p>
<p>Something about this event &#8211; its emphasis on the cuisine from both the mountainous and the coastal regions &#8211; calls such stereotypes into question.</p>
<p>The Ambassador, dressed in a casual sweater and wearing an academic&#8217;s spectacles, sought eye contact with all in attendance, his wife bejeweled and well-outfitted taking the lead to greet familiar faces. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, indulging and delighting in each and every symbol and real taste of home. The diplomats, other women and men in suits, began to undo ties and remove jackets, as the evening progressed. The room warmed and filled with chatter &#8211; Spanish the dominant language; a few bloggers and friends with mustaches speaking a mix of English and German made the room feel even smaller, though softly lit.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/chandelier-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1883" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/chandelier-2.jpg?w=640" alt="Chandelier 2" width="640" height="657" /></a></p>
<p>After the first two courses had made their rounds, a petite, young woman with a long-lensed camera and a wide grin marched confidently up to our group of wine-drinking Germans and expats, introducing herself with the line: <i>Hi, I&#8217;m from the Philippines! </i>Her husband, standing next to her in somber blacks, works for the Embassy of the Philippines in Berlin. He was raised in Chicago, Seattle, and Russia by a diplomatic father from the Philippines and a Spanish mother. Quite the childhood. Previously, the two had lived in Jakarta, having first met in Manila. Now, she runs a blog on her everyday life as a <a href="http://thediplomaticwife.com/blog/">Diplomatic Wife</a>, with the tagline &#8220;livin&#8217; life DiploStyle&#8221;.</p>
<p>DiploWife seemed to know many faces at the event. She <em>was invited by the Ambassador&#8217;s wife herself after meeting through the organization <a href="http://www.willkommen-in-berlin.de/">Willkommen in Berlin</a>, </em>she told me &#8211; a club for diplomats and their spouses, sponsored by the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The &#8220;Diplo-life&#8221; may be full of constant change and adaptation, but Berlin provides a community just for her type, as I somehow expected it would. <em>Everyone fits</em>, as Hector Sanchez said (or at least many).</p>
<p>As I turned to leave, I made sure to tell Hector that Colombia was no longer just cartels, cocaine, and Hollywood desert in my mind: <em>the food was delicious and exciting &#8211; I love guava!</em>  He seemed pleased, his eyes lightening with pride and appreciation. Delighting in a fresh avocado, picking up grains of pork-soaked rice with finger tips, sipping on guava juice, as if it were the elixir of home: this is how I left Hector Sanchez, culinary talent, and the rest of the Colombian Embassy. I knew, however, that I was not the only one to have fallen in love with Colombian food and two of its best chefs.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-002.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1882" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-002.jpg?w=640" alt="colombian-embassy-party-002" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-002.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-002-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Photo Source: Colombian Embassy</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t we just wish more embassies would take it upon themselves to allow us momentary homecoming, recreating childhood favorites and bringing people together over a symbolic table, reminiscent of a modern, finger-food Sunday dinner?</p>
<p>Part educational institution, part diplomatic agency, and most importantly, part expat/transnational hub of programming: this should be the new role of embassies, particularly in a city as diverse and adventurous as Berlin. It might just bring more of the locals together with some of its newcomers, uniting over the genius of duck woven into starch, particularly if this duck just happens to be a Berliner.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The Colombian community in Berlin is certainly not all food and drink &#8211; there are organizations which lobby for the kind of &#8216;change&#8217; Hector mentioned, encouraging enhanced human rights and an end to instability and insecurity.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-564.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-564.jpg?w=300" alt="France and Germany 2013-564" width="630" height="442" /></a>A major benefit of living in a city like Berlin is being able to experience its <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/welcome-to-collidoscope/">collision of cultures</a> on an everyday basis. It&#8217;s not everywhere that I can take the Vietnamese twins I tutor to a British café for tea and scones on Monday followed by breaking the Ramadan fast with my Tunisian friend at her Turkish boyfriend&#8217;s home on Tuesday.  Collision in this sense doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with a clash. <strong>It has everything to do with opportunity</strong>.</p>
<p>Another opportunity I take frequent advantage of is the <em>Thaiwiese</em> or Thai Park around the corner from my apartment building in Wilmersdorf. Coined Berlin&#8217;s &#8220;Little Thailand&#8221;, it&#8217;s a park turned semi-legal market where Thai women have been cooking and selling homemade Southeast Asian specialties under umbrellas for almost two decades. During the summer I&#8217;m here almost every weekend, inhaling shrimp summer rolls slathered in peanut sauce, papaya salad speckled with red chili, and iced coffee swimming in globs of cloyingly sweet condensed milk. I may meander the colorful rows for food, but my coffee always comes from the same umbrella: Kaffee Oma&#8217;s.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-561.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-561.jpg?w=300" alt="France and Germany 2013-561" width="617" height="410" /></a>Kaffee Oma is the self-appointed &#8220;coffee grandma&#8221; and most vocal vendor I&#8217;ve encountered on the <em>Wiese</em>. In what I&#8217;m not sure is a marking of extreme self-confidence or just limited language proficiency, Kaffee Oma almost exclusively refers to herself in the third person in an endearing mix of German and English. &#8220;Kaffee Oma in Berlin since 29 Jahren,&#8221; she tells me when I ask when she moved from Sukhothai, her home town in Thailand. &#8220;Sukhothai, they say it das Ende der Norden&#8221; she explains, pointing to an invisible map in the air.</p>
<p>Kaffee Oma&#8217;s math doesn&#8217;t always add up &#8211; in Berlin for 29 years, retired for 16, working in the Thai Park every day for 23  &#8211; but it&#8217;s all part of her charm. The same charm that elected her park liaison to the <em>Ordnungsamt, </em>Germany&#8217;s most &#8220;German&#8221; of bureaus in charge of order and regulations. Though the vendors don&#8217;t have official licenses, they are allowed to continue their activities under the watchful eye of these dark blue uniformed bureaucrats. Kaffee Oma says she&#8217;s the &#8220;Big Mouth&#8221; of the Park (because what&#8217;s one more self-proclaimed nickname?), regularly sampling the food to maintain quality and organizing meetings with other vendors about pricing and cleaning. You&#8217;ll notice a plate of <em>pad thai</em> will run you the same 5 Euro from one end of the umbrella row to the other. At the end of the day, trash bags are passed out. Not a strip of trash or papaya is to be found come morning.</p>
<div style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-550.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/france-and-germany-2013-550.jpg?w=198" alt="France and Germany 2013-550" width="361" height="549" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kaffee Oma</p></div>
<p>There are almost 6,000 Thai nationals living in Berlin, a number that doesn&#8217;t include those of Thai origin who have been naturalized as German citizens. While many Vietnamese were recruited to East Germany during the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s as guest workers by the GDR government, the influx of Thai immigrants mostly began after the Wall came down in the early 1990s. Immigration from Thailand to Germany has been predominantly female, with many initially coming to work as <em>au pairs</em> and nurses. Kaffee Oma is one of many who married a German and made Berlin her home, though she still makes yearly trips back to her other home.</p>
<p>The Thai Park itself has become about more than Berlin&#8217;s Thai community. &#8220;Do a lot of Chinese people come here?&#8221; asked my cousin&#8217;s boyfriend during their visit after recognizing some Mandarin chatter nearby. Before I could properly turn around, I heard English, German, and Thai coming from the same general direction. Everyday the park is rife with nationalities, languages, and multi-ethnic couples and families. The park is not just &#8220;Little Thailand&#8221;: parallel society or ethnic enclave. It&#8217;s an emblem of integration that extends beyond food, beyond Berlin, and even beyond Thailand. A place to enjoy melting pots of culture and curry.</p>
<p>You could go to the Thai Park any weekend &#8211; and I strongly encourage you do so &#8211; but this coming Saturday is particularly special. <strong>The Thai Youth Orchestra &#8211; <a href="http://thaiembassy.de/de/activities-events/activities-news/593-thai-jugendorchester-siam-sinfonietta-am-3-august-im-preussenpark-berlin">Siam Sinfonietta</a> &#8211; will be performing a free open-air concert on August 3 at 18:00.</strong> Come for the music, come for the food, come for Kaffee Oma.</p>

<p><em>Contrary to popular belief, the Thai Park is open everyday during the warmer months, though the number of vendors does increase greatly on weekends.</em> <em>The park&#8217;s official name is </em>Preußenpark<em> and can be found between U-Fehrbelliner Platz and U-Konstanzerstrasse in Wilmersdorf. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a city as big, gray, and Central European as Berlin, it's easy to feel anonymous and sometimes even lonely. What better way to meet new people than over an "adult" kid's birthday or a meal accompanied by language practice and carafes of Italian wine?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s something to be said for the 2 euro <em>Kebab</em>  as well as the 30 euro German-Japanese-inspired-organic-fusion tasting menu. But you don&#8217;t have to be a starving artist in Wedding or a <em>Bio-Mama</em> in Prenzlauer Berg to feel at home within Berlin food culture. Just a touch of research and a few steps off the beaten track yield a plethora of mid-range gastronomic adventures that will satisfy, surprise, and maybe even teach you something. The &#8220;supper club&#8221; &#8211; an event that&#8217;s more community gathering than meal &#8211; is one of them.  These semi-private, set-menu meals often showcase a particular theme, seasonal offering, ethnic cuisine, or community space. And they can run you as little as 15 euros.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/img_22961.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-388 aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/img_22961.jpg" alt="IMG_2296[1]" width="367" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>I became acquainted with the above tofu sausage and other revamped <a href="http://www.oh-sophia.net/daily-happa-kindergeburtstag-reloaded-photos/">kid&#8217;s birthday treats</a> at my first <a href="http://www.oh-sophia.net/category/happa-happa/">Happa, Happa</a> event a few weeks ago. In the heart of Kreuzberg at a community venue called<em> Merkezi</em> (Turkish for &#8220;market&#8221;), Chef Sophia puts on monthly themed 4-course dinners that attract a young, international, and vegetarian-friendly crowd. Surrounding me at the long, streamer-strewn table was a fellow German-American, a Turkish-German, an Irish expat, and a gentleman with a promising future in fermentation: somewhere in between courses he proudly revealed a bottle of homemade ginger liquor which was well-received by all.</p>
<p>Less than 10km northwest of <em>Merkezi</em> lies <a href="http://www.michele-mediterranea.de/de/home">Michele&#8217;s Feinkost &amp; Fremdsprachen</a> in Wedding. While I haven&#8217;t yet had the chance to sample the food, I can confirm that the coffee is strong and the space lovely. What primarily sparked my interest at Michele&#8217;s was the food-language combination, or as they describe it on their website, &#8220;the union of cultures, culinary delights, and linguistics&#8221;. Michele&#8217;s offers language courses in both the traditional sense and in the form of a casual meet-up, friendly to all budgets. On occasion, like <a href="http://www.michele-mediterranea.de/de/veranstaltungen/artikel/03-05-offene-buehne-und-menue">last night</a>, they also put on the 15 euro, 4-course meal.</p>
<p>In a city as big, gray, and Central European as Berlin, it&#8217;s easy to feel anonymous and sometimes even lonely. What better way to meet new people than over an &#8220;adult&#8221; kid&#8217;s birthday or a meal accompanied by language practice and carafes of Italian wine? Nestled somewhere in between intimate dinner at home and bustling bistro, the supper club is the perfect way to step outside of your (physical and mental) <em>Kiez</em> and awaken both appetite and conviviality.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy weekend, folks and happy art-watching, art-critiquing, art-consuming, if you find yourself in Berlin among the packed galleries from Neukölln to Friedenau (that’s right, there is art to be found in the Berlin answer to the suburb, as well).

<p>Happy weekend, folks and happy art-watching, art-critiquing, art-consuming, if you find yourself in Berlin among the packed galleries from Neukölln to Friedenau (that’s right, there is art to be found in the Berlin answer to the suburb, as well). For the rest of us, avoiding crowds and awkward glances from gallerists who accuse us with their eyes of only coming for the champagne, here are a few things that made me giggle or my stomach grumble. They are also things that don’t necessarily have ANYTHING to do with trend or art.</p>
<p>Berlin has seen a wave of young Israelis coming to study, to work, and to critique this city’s claim to hummus. The folks at <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/">Slow Travel Berlin</a> have put together a little piece on this culinary glorification of the chickpea, mapping its way through the different ethnic, religious, or just plain old neighborhood configurations that bring it to the table, particularly focusing on the Israeli-connection. An excerpt: <i>“For Ze’ev Avrahami, the owner of Sababa – Mama’s Kitchen in Mitte, there was no place in Berlin that corresponded to his idea of hummus and he felt compelled to open his own shop. ‘Hummus is not food,’ this burly man with his permanent five o’clock shadow tells me. ‘It’s a way of life. It’s addictive – it’s a drug. I eat hummus every day.’ He too, has a mission: Apart from hummus with various toppings, Sababa’s also serves a ‘peace salad’ made half of tomatoes, half of cucumbers and mint. ‘Some say it’s Arab, others say it’s Israeli, half and half, green and red.’”</i> Click <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/2013/04/23/from-azzam-to-zulas-hummus-in-berlin/">here</a> to read more from Anne Thomas’s greatttt article about the activist side of Middle-Eastern flavors in Berlin…</p>
<p>On the thread of food, there is a delicious Sudanese Café in three of Berlin&#8217;s districts called <a href="http://www.nil-imbiss.de/en/index.html">Nil</a>, which serves up street-food style plates of fava-bean falafel (Tamiya), fried bananas with peanut sauce, and delectable nutty soups with heaps of spice. If you stop by, be sure to chat a bit with those working, who seem to enjoy recommending toppings or even rolling their eyes at the first request for <em>scharf</em> (spicy). Second time for the spice request is the charm, however, and they will be sure to make your pita sandwich a memorable one!  Until you get a chance to visit in person or in spirit – depending on your location in the world – let this image of US President Barack Obama and Nil united make you giggle just a little: <a href="http://whenyouliveinberlin.tumblr.com/post/48351042694/tamiya-mit-hallumi-at-nil">When You Live in Berlin</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sometime last summer before I left the hot city behind for French and Portuguese countrysides, I visited a dear friend from Gambia weekly, often lingering in the warm confines of her flat for hours, sometimes venturing out with the babies for ice cream and fountains. I was both her peer-sponsor, as organized by the non-profit <a href="http://www.dicvberlin.caritas.de/40901.html">Caritas</a>, and her confidant and afternoon companion. I took copious notes of our encounters, in part processing my own feelings of foreignness exemplified when we were together. It was a strange comfort &#8211; speaking German with another whose tongue couldn&#8217;t always make the right sounds and whose children didn&#8217;t care that I sometimes misused the articles. I recorded one such day in sensory fragments. This is what my memory feels like&#8230;</em></p>
<p>The buzzer is broken. I enter when the neighbor boys pull their tricycles in for the day, heading behind them with arms bearing strawberries and a small bag of <em>Berliner</em>s (or just plain old donuts, as they are called in these parts). We are in Lichtenberg, nestled in the concrete blocks of East Berlin, where playgrounds are multi-lingual and Russian supermarkets rival the Kremlin in stature and color. It&#8217;s Friday. A is making lamb.</p>
<p>A has three small children with whom she shares a 12<sup>th</sup> floor apartment. It is a sticky summer day to descend into the GDR-decor building with little ventilation. Six sticky hands surely await my arrival. If I&#8217;m lucky, they will already be smeared with melted chocolate.</p>
<p>We, A and I, both come from different distant places. For this reason, a strange solidarity, an uncanny understanding, exists between us, just hangs in the air effortlessly without need for explanation or some ethnographic description. Naturally, we have very different stories of movement &#8211; less choice in our mobility, and less mobility in our eventual choice to stay. A Muslim from a port town, she married her husband – a convert to Islam from Berlin – at the age of 15, giving birth to a son shortly after. She left her home at 20, following her husband to Berlin after the second child began to form in her small-framed body. The difference between our narratives is clear. The drastic expanse between our positions in the world overwhelming.</p>
<p>And yet, within this dynamic city of ours we find each other on the 12<sup>th</sup> floor. We laugh together about Germans and their potato fetish, describe the last time we talked to our mothers, discuss the weather – knowing that both can conjure another climate in their mind and all the smells and sounds found only in that climate, only in its particular oh-so-distant landscape.</p>
<p>This is foreign in the everyday. This is longing and belonging at the same time.</p>
<p>For A, her home country is a place lived in strange memories. The children may eat Milka and Haribo but they will tolerate spice. Broiled fish in chili or ribs of lamb in a bed of sour stew. Onions sweated in pepper and vinegar on oily rice. Pineapple with salt. Dried cod fried in dough. Tamarind in everything. Sour, spicy, and sweet stuck to the curtains. “Africa” &#8211; as the boy says &#8211; in the carpet, on the tablecloth, in each and every pot and pan, making its way into daily life in the apartment of a Lichtenberg concrete sky-scraper. Gambia lives in skype sessions with the family members spread out across the European continent, the letters saved with postage from West African ports.</p>
<p>I exit the elevator, the door swinging grey metal like a Stasi archive.</p>
<p>She lets the front door to the flat drift open, crumpled welcome mat with dainty pink shoes of the two year-old blocking the entry. A sauce of peanut paste, tamarind, chili, broth, and an abundance of lemon simmers on the stove. She allows me to chop onions after I insist. Her tough and rough fingers douse them with cooking oil, nearly a cup of vinegar, and the blackest of black pepper. The little one to whom the pink shoes belong crawls into my lap. A pads into the living room, her tiny frame swaying, turns on the television. She loses the day in the shopping channel. She rests her eyes. The second-eldest cries in the next room.</p>
<p>I am the first person she has seen in days, and we discuss the heat and high-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>Supper is ready. A flies into the kitchen, pulling plates onto the table, the lamb from the oven, the sauces into their places onto bowls and dishes of fluffy white and wet green. The two year-old will use her hand to dip clumps of rice into a spicy, blood-red stew of bones. There is Africa in the curtains. Maybe there is even America in my voice.</p>
