										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before coming to Berlin, I was an archivist at an educational institution in Seattle, slowly working my way through a collection of artifacts that had been donated largely from Holocaust survivors and their families. Charged with accessioning (and/or digitally cataloging) over fifteen years of diffuse and often inconsistent records, I found myself forced to establish uncomfortable hierarchies. Collections are the result of measured calculations of value, often assessing the significance of one form of memory over another.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/memory_revised.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3827 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/memory_revised.jpg" alt="memory_revised" width="742" height="603" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/memory_revised.jpg 742w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/memory_revised-300x243.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/memory_revised-650x528.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></a></p>
<p>Any museum has to be painfully selective; time, space, and targeted mission result in a lot of rejection. Pure and simple, refusing to &#8216;collect&#8217; something belonging to a victim of the Holocaust or a veteran of WWII means embarking on tricky, emotional terrain.</p>
<p>Despite its challenge, I learned a lot from this experience &#8211; knowledge that has served me well in a different city, a different country. For it was not by chance that my first foot in any of Berlin&#8217;s rapidly revolving doors was in an institution that appraised, tracked, and managed large quantities of objects: an art gallery. Yet, to my relief, I was no longer responsible for the task of sorting, accepting, and rejecting. The hierarchy already existed. I simply had to regularly tighten its nuts and bolts.</p>
<p>Now, I am tasked with doing a little of both. Because, you see, I am eagerly awaiting to learn whether or not any of the PhD fellowships I applied for last year will take me. Did I mention that these programs are in the United States? So, as I chew through a new set of nails and amend an ever-lengthening scroll of plan b&#8217;s, I am mentally and physically preparing for the Great Move Back. By default, this involves packing up what will have been a four-year ride in what I can best &#8211; and momentarily, as I am sure this will change &#8211; describe as a lesson in patience, adaptation, and even &#8216;failure&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is the archivist&#8217;s ultimate challenge: collecting oneself.</p>
<p>It is easier to apply some value equation to the memories of others, a different story entirely when each beloved stage of your life is on the chopping block.</p>
<p><a href="http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Clifford-OnCollectingArtandCulture.pdf">According to the anthropologist Clifford Geertz</a>, &#8216;collecting&#8217; is an almost universal process across cultures. Some  sort of &#8220;gathering&#8221; of the objects of both the everyday and the past is an important part of what he calls &#8220;marking off a domain of self&#8221;. Just as meaning, value, and story are carefully created in museums, galleries, and other institutions of public curation and display, so our lives become careful practices in determining what is now important, what might fall away, and what is to follow us to our next (literal and figurative) destination.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Wohnwagon.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3837" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Wohnwagon-650x487.jpg" alt="Wohnwagon" width="580" height="435" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Wohnwagon-650x487.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Wohnwagon-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Wohnwagon-80x60.jpg 80w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Wohnwagon.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>I could not agree more with Clifford Geertz. As I plan which &#8216;artifacts&#8217; to take with me and which to disregard, I am accounting for who I once was, who I am now, and which stages of transformation are important to catalog into the future fabric of my life. Most importantly, I want to make sure I remember what this &#8220;Kelly&#8221; was like as a foreigner, as a U.S. national in the European Union, or as an &#8216;ex-pat resident&#8217; in a city like Berlin. And I want to be able to tangibly review and understand, perhaps again and again, how these stages and categories underwent change.</p>
<p>Thus, I need to &#8220;mark my domain&#8221; and &#8220;gather myself&#8221;.</p>
<p>It should be no surprise that immigrants, in particular, are constantly renegotiating hierarchies of value and meaning. Usually due to the constraints of geography and financial practicality, the contents of one&#8217;s home must be down-sized, even partly abandoned. Inevitably, pieces of childhood and/or integral moments of budding adulthood are left behind. Imagine that: deciding which family albums to send to a distant aunt for storage, which heirlooms to pass on to those who may never know what it is like to say goodbye to the literal bulk of memory, or which books to put up for sale, never-mind the story behind the inscriptions.</p>
<p>And yet, returning to the proverbial bassinet, to the place that promises comfort in familiarity, might be just as difficult for immigrants as was leaving it.</p>
<p>For me, this seems to be increasingly the case. The longer I live apart from the places where material comforts and their consumer habits formed and enveloped my surroundings, the more I recognize significance in those fewer objects I have come to possess. Less has, in this case, become truly more.</p>
<p>In the end, the way in which the self relates to &#8216;stuff&#8217; is, over time, subject to drastic change. The way in which these objects may shape who we think we are in the world does too. And this complicates the process of collection.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_66181.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3835" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_66181.jpg" alt="IMG_6618" width="580" height="435" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_66181.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_66181-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_66181-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>In an <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/16/lens-going-away/">article</a> I wrote here more than a year ago (on my challenging but enriching relationship with family, friends, and self on both sides of the Atlantic), I mentioned that the two-sided sense of home one experiences living abroad indefinitely affects one&#8217;s purchasing decisions. Towels, for example, fell into this category of things somehow neglected in the everyday of my Berlin consumerism. Now, one year later, I have quite an assortment of towels (thanks, Juri), in addition to newly minted whisky glasses, books both recently bought and borrowed, certainly more dishware, and a growing pile of greeting cards and heartfelt letters I don&#8217;t think will ever land entirely in the recycling.</p>
<p>And so the collecting, the sorting, the hierarchy of value begins. And with it, the worries of abandoning something I won&#8217;t miss until it&#8217;s no longer there.</p>
<p>For who will receive my salvaged desk with its coffee stains and dents &#8211; from years of free-lance, home-bound labor; my ever-growing tropical tree of a houseplant &#8211; a gift from my dear roommates; my antiquated but charming boombox &#8211; discovered in a damp basement; my IKEA comfy-chair &#8211; hauled in two-go&#8217;s from the south of Berlin? Will their future recipients understand what they signify? What they meant, to me?</p>
<p>More recently, I have tried to reconstruct the contents of the pack I first brought with me to Berlin, its meager (if not forced) element of chosen austerity: three pairs of shoes, two copies of classic literature, two copies of hard-knock poetry, one folder of important personal documents,  toothpaste and a toothbrush, a miniature Ganesha statue, a laptop &#8211; you get the picture. Establishing some sort of a contrast is helping me, now, to re-collect.</p>
<p>To complete this act of comparison, I rummaged through boxes of the miscellaneous items one learns to hold on to after more than three years of lived life in a cosmopolitan metropolis, with all the adventures in between: ticket stubs, letters, newspaper clippings (so antiquated-adorable, I know), event flyers, various city maps. What I have found is that the &#8220;Kelly&#8221; from three years ago might have expected to uncover herself in the objects she could fit in one suitcase, while this &#8220;Kelly&#8221; &#8211; as the more recent product of the European Union, parts of the German social system, and a fragmented but very resilient city of complex diversity &#8211; would never expect such a thing.</p>
<p>I am just too different; my surroundings are just too different, too complex even. But perhaps it has always been this way. And it has just taken me three years to see it.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/foot_revised1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3836 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/foot_revised1-556x650.jpg" alt="foot_revised" width="556" height="650" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/foot_revised1.jpg 556w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/foot_revised1-256x300.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></a></p>
<p>In this exercise of trying to curate the display of current me to future life, I have become (relatively) certain of one thing: that much of what I will take with me and much of what I will leave behind will become obsolete in the years to come. Because our hierarchies of what matters and what matters Right Now are constrained by time and its passage. Because we grow older. And so does our stuff, its significance and relationship to memory fading.</p>
<p>Leaving Berlin might mean losing some connection to the tangible trek between dreams, realizations, and moments of vulnerability that is our movement through years, our aging and maturation, in any sense. But it is only temporary. Indeed, collecting ourselves means leaving ourselves.</p>
<p>But only for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I visited my good friend D who, like me, is an American transplant*. We have similar trajectories and political ponderings, though his roots lie far from mine in the American Deep South (here’s a <a href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/place_where_you_live/view/chunky_mississippi_7753/">beautiful piece</a> he wrote about his home in Mississippi). D now lives in East London, where the corner store owner greets you in an upbeat banter and the sign to a ‘Carolina Fried Chicken’ joint dances in the light from the neighboring gastropub. Multicultural, maybe. But London’s multiculturalism has a few faces and facades. And, in the end, it’s the people that matter more than the cultural installation.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3351 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg" alt="img_1031-e1413145767969" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>My first night in London, over pints at a very hip and haptic microbrewery – the tables grainy and splitting with moisture – D and I discuss our common struggles: We chat about how so-called experiences ‘abroad’ are, in the end, defined by labor market restrictions and the particular brand of our passport. Three years ago I would have insisted that these things are fluid. But even with a class degree from a class English university, a work allowance is hard to come by if not impossible in an academic job market already squeezed by its nationals, he shares. I can only nod, my plunge into the newest Berlin job search looming at the edge of my half-empty pint.</p>
<p>Berlin, like London, is full of transplants, both temporary and permanent. Why so many? For the case of my friend D and me, why did we, in particular, take these leaps? Why do so many of our generation (and even those generations before us) move to cities in countries we have no <i>de facto</i> right to be in? Across the ocean, <i>jus soli</i>, <i>jus sanguinus</i>, <i>jus</i> whatever does, indeed, determine much of what is possible.</p>
<p>The U.K, though London, in particular, invites dreams and dreamers. Multiculturalism results, in part, from the diversity of all those who believe in possibility; immigrants churn up new identities and make places we feel right to inhabit. In the case of Americans in London, maybe it’s the common language, the similar sarcastic humor, or the attachment to butter-heavy things like pie and cookies, but it just makes sense to come here.</p>
<p>In D’s apartment, a short assemblage of brick and concrete in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Hackney">Hackney neighborhood</a>, I meet a few other fellow Americans. In many words, we all speak of the hurdles one must leap (in stride) for the right to not only remain but to earn an income at that, to really participate in a place one might co-construct but for which legal rights are lacking. One of them, a recent graduate of the London School of Economics, is tirelessly working to bend a clause or make a rule that will allow him to stay. There is a sense of marathon-running in the air, trying and trying until you can’t try anymore. Particularly palpable in a generation used to succeeding at most things, or told it is possible anyway.</p>
<p>But sometimes, it just doesn’t work out, at least temporarily, and many of those who come have to return to the places they left behind. But D seems optimistic.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3350 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3-464x650.jpg" alt="dylan_3" width="464" height="650" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3.jpg 464w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></a></p>
<p>This matters because cities like London and Berlin actively foster the transplant spirit, but this doesn’t mean that these places work to sustain it. According to recent research <a href="http://books.google.de/books?id=Cy7FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=%22migrants+or+expatriates+americans+in+europe%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bX6_r-fwO2&amp;sig=4Si_8b_0M8yuiU9Ti6hBkJ_Ijs8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M8IqVJW1IsbWPZzygOAN&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">on so-called American expatriates in Europe</a>, many transplants struggle for years at poorly paid jobs that are taken just to remain in the country. In Berlin, nearly half are underemployed and another third report contract-to-contract work (hustling, in other words). And yet, despite difficulties, many stay, which may be part financial, the costs of rehabilitating a life somewhere else, for example, and part mythical, i.e. what it means to constantly imagine future potential, then find it too difficult to forgo what might have been.</p>
<p>In any case, staying has a lot to do with the appearance of things. For how much of the transplant culture results from what one sees or experiences upon arriving, regardless of the actual rules of the game, even in spite of real barriers to inclusion? Put simply, if I see other Americans making it, or just a plethora of other nationalities making it, is it wrong to think I’ll make it?</p>
<p>Of course, the particular brand of passport produces a variety of experiences, but very few of us have a free-pass (excluding what D jokingly refers to as ‘fake Americans’ in London who legally remain in the country under an inherited European passport). Now, sitting in D’s kitchen with a liter of freshly brewed coffee (not tea), he tells me another story, one of a good friend’s predicament – an EU citizen, married to a Mexican national. In short, the immigration authorities of the U.K. have decided that the couple fails to meet requirements for residency in London, he tells me. Mexico is a country not seen favorably for transplantation; a hierarchy of acceptable migrants certainly does exist. But this all feels strangely hypothetical – this game of planning a life beyond borders, making moves and readying oneself for the counter. It is a lesson in rectifying a roster of rules with a vibrant diversity suggestive of more flexibility, more fluidity, than might be the case.</p>
<p>We leave the apartment and its conversation for a walk. Outside, it’s humid but pleasant, and the streets of D’s neighborhood are bursting with an eclecticism even beyond what the NY Times recently featured in ‘<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/travel/36-hours-in-east-london.html">36 hours in East London</a>‘ (as if the region needed its own holiday, apart from the financial men and women in suits of central London or the manicured streets of the West). Here, social housing projects tower above quaint town homes, neighbors trimming their rose bushes, bass piling out of a high window onto a long set of shears. Just down the road, one of London’s most bubbling food bazaars – a foodie’s scene of cultural consumption – is in full swing. Broadway Market: where German sausages, and meat pies, and lox bagels, and Persian kebab, and samosas, and ramen-to-go find frequent (young) patrons. We both delight in the anything-but-discordant multilingualism this variety yields.</p>
<p>In a pod of food carts just blocks from the market’s main drag, I find the best burrito I’ve had outside of the Western United States – a man with an air of L.A. dishing up marinated legumes, sauces streaming out of all sides of the tortilla like a blessing. A neighboring kiosk serves up what they call Filipino wraps (pork belly, assorted greens, tangy sauce), D’s favorite. As I walk to peruse other flavors, D shares his visa predicament with the owner of the wraps, explaining that this sandwich will be his last after a year of patronage. The owner offers to sponsor his visa, chuckling but serious, D tells me. Maybe he should take him up on his offer we joke, meaning it. D smiles.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pork-belly.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3349" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pork-belly-488x650.jpg" alt="pork-belly" width="400" height="532" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pork-belly-488x650.jpg 488w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pork-belly-225x300.jpg 225w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pork-belly.jpg 489w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>It’s easy to feel welcomed here.</p>
<p>Far away from East London, I find myself in the kitchen of a German transplant on the ground floor of an elderly but charming home in a neighborhood near Kensington.  From my luggage I unload mustard I’ve carted across the channel, tubes I was almost not allowed to take onto the plane. <i>You just can’t find this here</i>, my host says, that certain spicy mustard.</p>
<p>Her friends are all from somewhere else, she shares, <i>but the problem with transplants is that they all leave eventually, and then, all of a sudden, you don’t have any friends</i>. She is slowly rebuilding the circle, <i>but it’s hard</i>, she tells me, <i>when everyone is from somewhere else.</i></p>
<p>As we leave the far West neighborhood, its quiet lanes juxtaposed with newer blocks of community housing and industrial outgrowth, we pass an office for remittances – transplants from East Africa sending their earnings back ‘home’. Even here, some people are making it.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3347 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001.jpg" alt="wp_20140919_001" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_20140919_001-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>My last day in London, my travel companion and I board a train to Brick Lane, snaking above a meat market, halal lambs hanging like carpets and voices rising up into numbers. Brick Lane, a curated experience of all that London attracts, the object of film, book, and tourism, is the sharpened edge of the city’s sale of eclecticism. It is a blend of curry houses and backdoor sweets shops for tourists and locals alike; it is the contrast between posh chocolatiers and wholesale textile vendors or between grunge coffee houses and chic boutiques. But it is not what is seen here that inspires but what is implied: that this – reproduction of home, community-making in memory – is possible. Even if it always isn’t.</p>
<p>After another burrito, this time seasoned with garam masala, we chat with an artist crafting overt social commentary, something he calls ‘the Prejudice Project’. With a long beard and dark eyes, he has likely faced that which his project targets. His bright smile opens up to pure optimism as we discuss diversity politics, however. But things can be difficult, indeed: In London, it’s not as free as in Berlin, he shares, a place he once inhabited, squatting in Köpenick and composing works that now hang in this design outlet just off Brick Lane. <i>The folks here are different</i>, he says, pausing, belonging to a <i>certain type</i>. He gives me a postcard, <i>a token to remember our conversation</i>: ‘#Paradise’ printed on a white surface, a glimpse of blue sky in the background.</p>
<p>D is moving back to the United States. After a preliminary job search and the weight of a different kind of bureaucracy on his shoulders, it seems like the best thing, for now. As he prepares for his departure to Philadelphia he looks mournful, visiting his favorite food carts and bookshop, the dingy canal with folks living out of boats – the air thick with oil and wet brush – before it all becomes just another place where he once lived. <i>I’d like to come back</i>, he says, <i>but then I just walk around and look at all the people here and want to go up and ask ‘like, how do you live here? What do you do?’</i> Perhaps, many of them are themselves transplants, just figuring it out as they go, leaving eventually for another place.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say, given the look of things.</p>

<p>*I am using this word “transplant” intentionally, avoiding terms such as “expat” or even “immigrant”, as they are often bogged down with allusions to class, privilege, and assumptions about the irrelevance of borders or passports for certain members of the global community. When it comes to migration, the language is tricky but important. It helps to start with words that we feel we truly inhabit or experience, even if imperfectly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Immigrant integration and identity can be very personal subjects and not everyone wishes for their views and experiences to be made public. Though all the stories in this interview are true, names and some cities have been changed to protect the artist&#8217;s identity, per his request.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_0609.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_0609.jpg?w=640" alt="Admiralbruecke in Kreuzberg" width="604" height="604" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy (<a href="http://www.uberlin.co.uk/stereotypes-different-expats-youll-meet-berlin/">and admittedly amusing</a>) to reduce expats to stereotypes, as if we all neatly fall into one or the other category based on which country we hail from, what we do for a living, or where we party and eat brunch. Reality is always more nuanced and multi-dimensional. Dare we even say, interesting?</p>
<p>Take Alex, American-born artist and documentary filmmaker living in Berlin. On first sight, the dual American-Polish citizen may appear to fit into a few niches: creative type with a studio in <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2014/02/20/lens-an-ode-to-the-maybachufer/">trendy Kreuzberg</a>, one of a rapidly growing number of young <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/07/rant-or-rave-jew-in-a-box/">Jews in Berlin</a>, jetsetter popping between speaking engagements in Europe and gigs in Los Angeles and Seattle. But Alex&#8217;s life in Berlin was more happy accident than predestined by career or background. The idea came from a professor who happened to hear him &#8220;complaining in the hallway about wanting to leave [his homestate] Illinois” and suggested a semester program in Offenbach near Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alex left the U.S. for Germany, and in the past decade, has spent time in Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Karlsruhe. For the past six years he has been Berlin-based.</p>
<p><a href="http://friedrichshainblog.de/santa-maria-gutes-mexikanisches-restaurant-in-berlin-kreuzberg/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2225" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg.jpg" alt="santa maria in kreuzberg" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg.jpg 600w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I meet Alex in his studio on Adalbertstraße, where he shows me some clips of his documentary films and tells me start-ups are starting to take-over former artist space in the building. &#8220;Do you feel integrated?&#8221; I ask later over habanero-spiked food and aguas frescas at Oranienstraße&#8217;s Santa Maria Restaurant. &#8220;You&#8217;re really making me think here,&#8221; Alex ponders, slicing into his pumpkin burrito, &#8220;it&#8217;s a top-heavy question though, isn&#8217;t it? Depends on what you mean by &#8216;integrated&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex isn&#8217;t a fan of dichotomies, the idea that every question always has a right or wrong answer. He prefers to see the world in three dimensions, which he describes as &#8220;the pause in-between inhaling and exhaling&#8221;. Fittingly, by the end of our conversation, he&#8217;s given us three dimensions through which to consider integration.</p>
<p><strong>The Dance Performance</strong></p>
<p>Alex recently attended a dance performance by Wang Ramirez, a pair that works between Berlin, Paris, and London and are &#8220;<a href="http://wangramirez.com/">as diverse as the cultures that clashed and harmonized when its founders met</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“She is ethnically Korean but grew up in Germany, and he grew up in France but has Spanish roots,” Alex explains. &#8220;At one part during the evening&#8217;s program, a woman comes on stage and asks them one of those typical questions about language and identity. How their backgrounds influence their performance and such. Wang and Ramirez respond in a mix of languages and movements, getting progressively more incoherent, to show how essentially absurd and futile that question can be.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/79000095"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-2223" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wangramirez.jpg" alt="wangramirez" width="601" height="335" /></a><br />
<strong>The Jewish Guilt</strong></p>
<p>While attending a conference in Weimar to hear a professor friend of his speak, Alex was approached by a young German student looking for participants in a Jewish identity project.&#8221;He had just found out that he had some Jewish ancestry,&#8221; Alex recounts. &#8220;He wanted to do a photography project on young Jews in Germany to acknowledge this, and asked us if we would participate. Later, when my friend and I were alone and could discuss openly, we realized this project, like so many others, was focused on the past. My friend said, &#8216;why doesn&#8217;t he focus on Germany&#8217;s future instead, as a multicultural country? Perhaps learning Turkish would be a more meaningful contribution.’&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Subway Encounter</strong></p>
<p>One late night on the U-Bahn, Alex found himself among a group of young Turkish-Germans. &#8220;People can&#8217;t usually tell where I&#8217;m from right off the bat. These guys in the U-Bahn asked me. My grandfather was a Sephardic Jew from Beirut, so I just told them I had a Lebanese grandfather and left out the rest. Once they thought I was Arab they started on how they love everyone and all religions&#8230; <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">Muslims</a>, Christians, Jews, etc. Later I wondered how the conversation would have been different if I had said I was Jewish.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aviatorsandacamera.com/travel/nye-art-technology-in-berlin-part-2/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-2224" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn.jpg" alt="berlin u-bahn" width="533" height="397" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn.jpg 259w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ubahn-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Berlin is a great place to come and figure out who you are and what you want to do. It&#8217;s just not the best place to make that happen, funding and opportunity wise,&#8221; Alex explains. &#8220;I always say Berlin is a city full of possibility, but not necessarily potential.&#8221; Alex, like many expats, is not sure what the future holds, other than it being a transnational one. No matter how much opportunity exists on the West Coast, it seems he will always be tied to Germany and, more specifically, Berlin. &#8220;Berlin is a city that breaks my heart,&#8221; he reminisces, &#8220;it broke my heart even before I lived here. Just the thought that a place like this even exists.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What role do embassies play in the lives of foreign nationals abroad? Beyond pure administration and diplomacy, cultural events that allow for a homecoming, a return to childhood, and a bringing together of compatriots might change how immigrants and expats live abroad and the involvement of embassies and consulates therein. The Embassy of Columbia in Berlin sponsored an event that did something just like this. A few weeks ago in Neukölln, Colombians and non-Colombians united over the genius of duck woven into starch - the duck, a true Berliner...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1874" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg?w=640" alt="columbia" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia.jpg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia-300x200.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/columbia-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>What role do embassies play in the lives of foreign nationals abroad? Many of us living in a country for which we do not possess a passport are likely to associate our local embassy with administrative assistance, i.e. replacing documents needed to prove our identity and belonging in the international system. In many public discussions of transnationalism and cosmopolitanism, the nation-state can take on an equally administrative face. <em>It&#8217;s all about technology, no longer about borders or space; the world is post-modern, and so is identity.</em></p>
<p>As the anthropologist <a href="http://www.arjunappadurai.org/">Arjun Appadurai </a>preached in the 1990s, human societies are experiencing a &#8216;deterritorialization&#8217;, making the nation-state less and less relevant for our real lives, its relevance relegated to the small tasks we rely on for bureaucratic systems to function properly.</p>
<p>But it is <em>not </em>this black and white. For those of us who have lived apart from all that was <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/16/lens-going-away/">once familiar and full of memory</a> for a period longer than the term &#8216;abroad&#8217; can afford, the food &#8211; most importantly &#8211; of the former territory of &#8216;home&#8217; becomes something we long for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_fried-plantains.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1875" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_fried-plantains.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_fried plantains" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>And so this rave asks a simple question: What if (nation-)states and their representative institutions abroad played both a symbolic and tangible role in the lives of immigrants holding passports from these places?</p>
<p>There happens to be an example for such, namely the Embassy of Colombia in Germany and its recent culinary festival:</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Sophia and I were invited to this special event, meant to recreate the flavors of many a Colombian childhood in a chic Neukölln space for foodies &#8211; <a href="http://www.feinschlicht.de/">Manufaktur Feinschlicht</a> &#8211; complete with a charming Ambassador and homesick interns. The event was the backdrop to the presentation of a cook book straight out of the homeland, entitled <em>Colombia, Cooking by Regions</em> by Maria Lía Neira Restrepo. With a  full culinary program, using ingredients one can find here in Germany, two worlds were forged on a brisk Berlin evening. This union meant homecoming for some and travel for others.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_candles-table.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1880" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_candles-table.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Candles table" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Renowned chef <a href="http://www.restaurantedianagarcia.com/home.html">Diana Garcia</a>, featured in <em>Colombia, Cooking by Regions</em>, was flown out to Berlin for the event, along with pal, chef Magda Hamon. The two women brought decades of experience, a power house of flavor, and the openness and friendly encounter akin to a family Sunday dinner (for those of us that remember those).</p>
<p>The women were paired with two German chefs &#8211; both looking a bit like they should be flinging fish at Pike Place Market, rather than managing finger foods. In minutes the kitchen and serving foyer were a buzz with the good vibes of cross-cultural collaboration. The Germans, Kai and Robert, filleted brined salmon with rough hands, delicately arranging plates of plantain-based crostini, while the two Colombian ladies tended large cuts of pork belly and whisked various sauces to life in the kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1877" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg?w=640" alt="colombian-embassy-party-001 embassy deriv" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-embassy-party-001-embassy-deriv-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Photo Source: Colombian Embassy</p>
<p>The chefs delivered the beautifully-presented treats to the guests themselves, wandering through the room in white coats, making eye contact with eager mouths, answering questions about ingredients and origin, making all feel welcome to partake in something, well, just great and gluttonous.</p>
<p>Glorifying both the Berlin environs and Colombian roots, it was easy to relate to the enthusiasm and personal connection to the dishes that seemed obvious through taste and composition.</p>
<p>10 waves of savory bites passed through the intimate space where we all gathered around the bar, which never failed to serve up rows of guava-rum puree, delicate glasses of Prosecco, and bottles of rich Colombian wine (both red <em>and </em>white, and both delicious). Surrounded by the chutneys and other jarred creations of <a href="http://www.feinschlicht.de/">Manufaktur Feinschlicht</a>, the ever-increasing guests eyed the prep table and the hall to the kitchen, anxiously awaiting the rolling arrival of new platters and, above all, the kind-eyed and wide-smiled chefs.</p>
<p><em>Colombia is a country of flowers and fruits &#8211; we hope you will taste that! We also love meat, </em>Diana Garcia told the crowd, beaming and laughing a bit in the face of so many cameras.</p>
<p>Pork belly in a muddy water sauce with Berlin&#8217;s (happy) <em>Schwein</em>; fried plantain with a cheese crust; <em>lox</em> on potato-pillows with a healthy dollop of guacamole; breaded and seared scallops on coconut rice (the coconut hailing from the coastal region of Colombia, according to the chefs); creme de leche in pieces big enough to give the teeth something to work on; a creamy pudding enveloping local fruits and Colombian flowers; <em>Currywurst</em> with a bit of guava in the sauce; duck rice with a Berlin-grown bird: all with both decadence and simplicity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_scallop.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1876" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_scallop.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Scallop" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>The young Colombians around me, most of them with positions at the embassy or friends with such coveted diplomatic jobs, celebrated every dish, every reference to summers on the coast, to lunches with grandma, to the country&#8217;s everyday bounty becoming so special through distance.</p>
<p><em>Guava, milk pudding: my favorite things! </em>Hector Sanchez, one of the embassy interns told me, after I openly praised the addition of guava to everything forever and ever. He has <em>been away from Colombia for longer than ever</em>, was studying in Geneva before coming to Berlin, and will be in Berlin for at least one year. <em>I enjoy Berlin because here, everyone fits,</em> even the Colombians. <em>Here I can relax and feel at home</em>, he said, eyeing the second round of <em>Chicharrones</em> and speaking a few adoring words to the room and the chef, the crunchy skin sliding into his mouth.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_hector.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1878" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/colombian-culinary_hector.jpg?w=640" alt="Colombian Culinary_Hector" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>When I asked if it is easy to recreate these Colombian flavors in Berlin &#8211; <em>I have heard that there is a Colombian food store in Mehringdamm, but I&#8217;ve never been there. </em>I couldn&#8217;t seem to find it either. Jaggery, fresh sugar cane, or guava punch are ever elusive, it seems. We talked about the role of the embassy, how such institutions are charged with many often symbolic tasks, such as this one. But it isn&#8217;t symbolic, <em>it reminds me of home</em>, he added.</p>
<p>And so, <em>What do you want Germans to know about Colombia, about Colombians?, </em>I asked, really having no anticipated answer to this question, which is rare, when I choose to ask one. <em>I want them to know that Colombia is changing. It used to be dangerous, but things are getting better. Change, Change! </em>I mentioned that many associate Colombia with films about drug cartels trucking cocaine across the desert in military fatigues. <em>In Bogota it is cold, like 18 degrees all the time and is at a high elevation! And the coastal region is beautiful and where many of these foods come from. You don&#8217;t see that in the</em> <em>movies</em>, he added, a bit flustered. <em> </em></p>
<p>Something about this event &#8211; its emphasis on the cuisine from both the mountainous and the coastal regions &#8211; calls such stereotypes into question.</p>
<p>The Ambassador, dressed in a casual sweater and wearing an academic&#8217;s spectacles, sought eye contact with all in attendance, his wife bejeweled and well-outfitted taking the lead to greet familiar faces. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, indulging and delighting in each and every symbol and real taste of home. The diplomats, other women and men in suits, began to undo ties and remove jackets, as the evening progressed. The room warmed and filled with chatter &#8211; Spanish the dominant language; a few bloggers and friends with mustaches speaking a mix of English and German made the room feel even smaller, though softly lit.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/chandelier-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1883" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/chandelier-2.jpg?w=640" alt="Chandelier 2" width="640" height="657" /></a></p>
<p>After the first two courses had made their rounds, a petite, young woman with a long-lensed camera and a wide grin marched confidently up to our group of wine-drinking Germans and expats, introducing herself with the line: <i>Hi, I&#8217;m from the Philippines! </i>Her husband, standing next to her in somber blacks, works for the Embassy of the Philippines in Berlin. He was raised in Chicago, Seattle, and Russia by a diplomatic father from the Philippines and a Spanish mother. Quite the childhood. Previously, the two had lived in Jakarta, having first met in Manila. Now, she runs a blog on her everyday life as a <a href="http://thediplomaticwife.com/blog/">Diplomatic Wife</a>, with the tagline &#8220;livin&#8217; life DiploStyle&#8221;.</p>
<p>DiploWife seemed to know many faces at the event. She <em>was invited by the Ambassador&#8217;s wife herself after meeting through the organization <a href="http://www.willkommen-in-berlin.de/">Willkommen in Berlin</a>, </em>she told me &#8211; a club for diplomats and their spouses, sponsored by the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The &#8220;Diplo-life&#8221; may be full of constant change and adaptation, but Berlin provides a community just for her type, as I somehow expected it would. <em>Everyone fits</em>, as Hector Sanchez said (or at least many).</p>
<p>As I turned to leave, I made sure to tell Hector that Colombia was no longer just cartels, cocaine, and Hollywood desert in my mind: <em>the food was delicious and exciting &#8211; I love guava!</em>  He seemed pleased, his eyes lightening with pride and appreciation. Delighting in a fresh avocado, picking up grains of pork-soaked rice with finger tips, sipping on guava juice, as if it were the elixir of home: this is how I left Hector Sanchez, culinary talent, and the rest of the Colombian Embassy. I knew, however, that I was not the only one to have fallen in love with Colombian food and two of its best chefs.</p>

<p>Now, don&#8217;t we just wish more embassies would take it upon themselves to allow us momentary homecoming, recreating childhood favorites and bringing people together over a symbolic table, reminiscent of a modern, finger-food Sunday dinner?</p>
<p>Part educational institution, part diplomatic agency, and most importantly, part expat/transnational hub of programming: this should be the new role of embassies, particularly in a city as diverse and adventurous as Berlin. It might just bring more of the locals together with some of its newcomers, uniting over the genius of duck woven into starch, particularly if this duck just happens to be a Berliner.</p>

<p><em>The Colombian community in Berlin is certainly not all food and drink &#8211; there are organizations which lobby for the kind of &#8216;change&#8217; Hector mentioned, encouraging enhanced human rights and an end to instability and insecurity.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img_2302.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img_2302.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_2302" width="640" height="425" /></a>It&#8217;s not everyday you&#8217;re on TV, let alone get alluded to as a traitor by a host of public figures, including the Minister of the Treasury, all for being an expat. But both of these things happened to my friend and colleague Moran Yaheli when she was recently profiled in a TV report about Israelis living abroad.</p>
<p><em>We were on 4 episodes, there were 5 in total, and I&#8217;ve been on the morning talk show and the radio, </em>Moran recounts&#8230; <em>and I was told that a satire show used our part from the morning show. This Sunday I&#8217;m going to be on another morning show panel. I&#8217;m a Z-list celebrity!</em></p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll get back to that.</p>
<p>Moran moved to Berlin from Tel Aviv in 2011 after meeting her now fiancé, Bastiaan (Bas). Their story alone is a lesson in 21st century romances: they met on the online Couchsurfing platform, and Moran spent a few nights on Bas&#8217; couch in Amsterdam while traveling around Europe. After surviving a few months of long-distance Skype calls and the occasional visit, the two decided to make a home for themselves in Europe. They both found jobs in Berlin and now live together in the <em>Schöneberg</em> district. Last year they welcomed their first baby, a beautiful boy named Tommy.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1627" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto.jpeg?w=640" alt="Israel part II 081 kl auto" width="640" height="425" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto.jpeg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto-300x199.jpeg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto-650x431.jpeg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Tommy is primed to grow up as what has been coined the Third Culture Kid (TCK): &#8220;a person who has spent a significant part of his or her developmental years outside their parents’ culture&#8221; (David Pollock). With an Israeli mother, Dutch father, childhood (or at least babyhood) in Germany, and frequent trips to both mother- and fatherlands, Tommy will grow up navigating at least three cultural codes, languages, and geographies. It may seem like an unusual life, but it&#8217;s more and more a norm in our increasingly globalized and interconnected world. Even Buzzfeed published an <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/31-signs-youre-a-third-culture-kid">article</a> on &#8220;signs you&#8217;re a TCK&#8221; that included swearing in multiple languages, time zone expertise, and a transient understanding of &#8220;home&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>Tommy is a child of combined cultures, </em>Moran reflects<em>&#8230; he has both an Israeli and Dutch passport&#8230; but even though he was born in Berlin he can&#8217;t be a German citizen (without giving up the Israeli one). It&#8217;s the same for me, I feel I have more than one &#8220;home&#8221;, and I guess he will have that, too.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1580" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg" alt="285679521_640" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/41264088">Source</a></p>
<p>With only 8 months behind him so far in this world, Tommy has already taken two lengthy trips to Tel Aviv and one to the Netherlands. He is a dual citizen and hears an average 2-4 languages per day: Hebrew from his mom, Dutch from his dad, German from his environment, and English, the language in which his parents communicate.</p>
<p><em>We want to do the OPOL method, &#8216;One Parent One Language&#8217;, have you heard of it? </em>Moran asks me.<em> That way he gets just Hebrew from me, just Dutch from Bas. Tommy&#8217;s baby noises are kind of both Hebrew and Dutch, he does a lot of the &#8220;Chhh&#8221; noise&#8230; </em>she giggles.<em> When the neighbor babysits he only speaks German with him. I want him to go to a bilingual Hebrew-German Kita </em>(child care center).</p>
<p>Tommy is not just (im)migrant, not just citizen, but somewhere in between. He was born and lives in Berlin but isn&#8217;t a German citizen. If he moves to either Israel or the Netherlands, he will be moving there as a citizen but won&#8217;t necessarily have grown up there. His diverse lineage, cross-cultural upbringing, and even his darker features may mean he carries the mark of <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/"><em>Migrationshintergrund</em></a> most of his life, whether in Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, or somewhere else. Tommy will &#8220;build relationships to all these cultures but perhaps never have full ownership of any&#8221;. TCKs often feel a stronger sense of belonging and connection to others who have a similar background rather than a particular one. When Tommy grows up, he may fall in love and marry another TCK, someone who grew up in Rome with Singaporean and British parents, or perhaps someone from Sydney with French and Brazilian parents. Studies say his chances of doing so are <a href="http://www.denizenmag.com/2011/09/infographic-the-modern-third-culture-kid/">1 in 4</a>. His future inclination to raise his children as TCKs? <a href="http://www.denizenmag.com/2011/09/infographic-the-modern-third-culture-kid/">Even higher</a>. His sense of home will be an abstract one, one that he feels more in relation to people, memories, and experiences than citizenship, borders, and geography.</p>
<p><em>I can&#8217;t vote in Israel because Israeli doesn&#8217;t allow absentee ballots&#8230; even my cousin </em>(in Israel)<em> doesn&#8217;t think I should be able to vote in their elections because I don&#8217;t live there, </em>Moran rolls her eyes.<em> But even though I don&#8217;t live in Israel, I still feel it&#8217;s my home&#8230; my friends and family are there. As for Tommy, he will have 3 homes for now and as he grows maybe just two- Israel which he will visit a lot, and Holland where he will likely live at some point. If we&#8217;re in Holland or Germany, I&#8217;m going to be seen as a foreigner. I don&#8217;t want Tommy to be made fun of or be ashamed of me. So it&#8217;s important for me that Tommy meets and grows up in an international environment, with kids who also have diverse backgrounds. With other kids like him.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-08-16-38-33.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-08-16-38-33.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-10-08 16.38.33" width="512" height="682" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Confusions and complications aside, studies on Third Culture Kids show that they reap a whole host of benefits from their intercultural upbringings and lifestyles: TCKs live in four countries during their lives on average, 85% speak two or more languages (47% speak three or more), and 90% earn a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree with 40% going on to further study. Statistically they&#8217;re a well-educated, well-rounded, and well-suited group for the demands of the 21st century, both professionally and personally. They just may have difficulty articulating to you <a href="http://vimeo.com/41264088">where home is</a>.</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t know where Tommy will end up, </em>considers Moran.<em> Right now the current situation in Israel is complicated and I can&#8217;t see us going back. Economically, politically, demographically, religiously, etc. But I am not giving up hope&#8230; Israel is a beautiful place, the best place, it&#8217;s just unfortunately in crisis. If things get better I would be on the first plane home. And, if the situation improves, I would love for Tommy to choose Israel, too.  </em></p>
<p>As to the economic situation&#8230;</p>
<p><em>The rising number of Orthodox Jews is scary and it is so expensive to live in Tel Aviv. I paid the same rent for a shoebox in Tel Aviv as I do now with Bas in our big, new flat in Berlin. Groceries are over twice as expensive in Israel than Germany!</em></p>
<p>126% more expensive in fact, which brings us back to the TV report. Grocery and rent costs were one topic Moran and a series of other Israeli expats were asked about when interviewed about living abroad. The economic situation in Israel is pretty dire and gave rise to the ongoing social justice protests that began in 2011, the largest in the country&#8217;s history with over 1 million people gathering in Tel Aviv&#8217;s Rabin Square. While mostly focused on the cost of living differences, Moran also got token questions about what it feels like to be a Jew in Germany. On the show, the journalist shuttles her over to the Holocaust Memorial to the Jews in <em>Mitte</em>. He&#8217;s curious how she feels when she sees it.</p>
<p><em>The Jewish Memorial doesn&#8217;t speak to me,</em> Moran explained first to the journalist and later to me. <em>It&#8217;s more the everyday. Like seeing trains covered in snow&#8230; we don&#8217;t have snow covered trains in Israel and it reminds me of images we saw in school of the deportation of the Jews. Or hearing the voice on the train say &#8216;</em>Ausstieg&#8217;<em> which always makes me think of &#8216;Auschwitz&#8217;. Seeing old people on the street and wondering what role they played in World War II.</em></p>
<p>And the Minister of the Treasury? When asked to respond to the TV report, he was in Budapest, giving a speech on antisemitism.</p>
<p><em>A word to all those who have &#8220;had it&#8221; and left for Europe&#8230; </em>Moran translates his response for me&#8230;<em> I&#8217;m here to deliver a speech in the Budapest Parliament about antisemitism, to remind them of how they tried to kill my father here only because Jewish people didn&#8217;t have their own land, how they did kill my grandfather in a camp, how they starved my uncles, how my grandmother was rescued at the last second from a &#8220;death march&#8221;. So excuse me if I&#8217;m a bit impatient with people who are willing to throw away the only homeland the Jewish people have ever had, just because Berlin is &#8220;more convenient&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Other politicians and one of the country&#8217;s most famous lawyers went so far as to call the Israeli expats in Berlin &#8220;traitors&#8221; and &#8220;slime that crawls in the sewer of Jewish society&#8221;, respectively. On the whole, however, Moran reports positive responses and understanding from those back in Israel, something she claims is a shift from the Zionist past.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s the older generation that has a problem with people leaving Israel&#8230; the ones who escaped antisemitism, built the country and died in wars to protect it, </em>Moran explains. <em>They see our leaving as abandoning the ship, the cause, the ideal&#8230; for money. My parents were born in Israel but my grandparents were from Europe, so I have two passports, too, </em><em>Israeli and Romanian. </em><em>I want Tommy to grow up with both tradition and choice&#8230; for his religion and for where he makes his home. </em></p>
<p>And choices he will have&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight, the performing arts meet Berlin&#8217;s identity crisis. The <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/">English Theatre Berlin</a>&#8216;s new piece by <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/der-neue-der-amerikanische-theatermacher-daniel-brunet-beschaeftigt-sich-ab-dem-15-februar-mit-der/7699722.html">Daniel Brunet</a> asks the hot question, &#8216;Who is a real Berliner?&#8217;. A similar question haunts those moving to big cities everywhere. From that Somewhere-else lying in the sinister boundaries of suburbia to the other city 300 kilometers away with nothing left to talk about, the uncertainty of belonging spikes the air. &#8220;Are you a New Yorker?&#8221; &#8220;Well, I was born here.&#8221; &#8220;Are you a Parisian?&#8221; &#8220;Well, I study here.&#8221; Those people: pretending to be from the &#8216;Bay&#8217; when they are really from Sacramento, CA; pretending to belong to slick air London while knowing only the Midlands; claiming to be one with Mumbai because of a summer spent in its markets. We know those people. We likely belong to them. As a friend of mine asked recently, &#8220;When do I get to call myself a Berliner?&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://static.zitty.de/fm/16/thumbnails/31_24-bu-2_ETB_ECHTER-BERLINER_Foto-by-RodDi-Sciascio.jpg.7573127.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>More often than not, cities divide their residents into the insiders//outsiders, frequently the natives//the foreigners, making the question of &#8216;Who is a real&#8230;&#8217; ever more pertinent. The soundness of the categories doesn&#8217;t matter, just the role they play in validating one group at the expense of another. In Berlin, such dichotomies make things interesting, chaotic, dangerous, tense, and at best &#8211; exciting. They inspire <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/29/prejudice-with-condiments-understanding-schwabenhass/">Nazi-esque graffiti against affluent Southern Germans</a> or fuel <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/09/interview-ali-zoe-and-the-gentrification-debate/">anti-gentrification conflicts that end up turning immigrant against immigrant</a> in the name of hierarchy. But thanks to one strong end of a sociopolitical dichotomy, this city has plenty of outlets for its tensions, i.e. plenty of creative art forms and forums. The tension, however, is one reason the arts have come to be in the first place.</p>
<p>An outlet taking center stage in such debates (excuse the pun) is the theater.</p>
<p>Allow the English Theatre of Berlin to introduce its newest play (or performance piece, according to the theater&#8217;s new <em>stick</em>) pertaining exactly to this dichotomy. &#8216;Echter Berliner!!! Ihr nicht fuck you&#8217; &#8220;is a documentary theater piece exploring the diverging and converging experiences of so-called expats, often coming from comparably richer countries who travel to Berlin for self-realization, with those of so-called immigrants, often coming from comparably poorer countries for financial survival. At least, these are the generalizations (<a href="http://www.etberlin.de/production/echter-berliner-ihr-nicht-fuck-you/">English Theatre Berlin</a>)&#8221;. We know differently, know that the lines are blurred and ink-stained at best, which is why putting them on stage is so brilliantly illustrative, because knowledge doesn&#8217;t always lead to a change of behavior.</p>
<p>This performance is the first segment in &#8216;Aliens of Extraordinary Abilities?&#8217;, a two-part project &#8220;investigating the experiences of so-called expats and so-called immigrants in Berlin and its rapidly changing cityscape&#8221;. The second part, Terrain of Threshold Voices, is a collaboration with <a href="http://www.district-berlin.com/current.php?categorie_id=24">DISTRICT Kunst- und Kulturförderung</a> and set to premiere in November and December.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.etberlin.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ETB_ECHTER-BERLINER__Lynn-Femme4_foto-by-Manuela-Schauerhammer-224x300.jpg" alt="ETB_ECHTER BERLINER__Lynn Femme4_foto by Manuela Schauerhammer" /></p>
<p>In tonight&#8217;s piece, the theatrical result of the community-driven work of six performers hailing from both camps &#8211; the immigrants and the expats &#8211; is a verbatim reproduction of 60 interviews framing the question of belonging in Berlin. Giving vignettes and reflections, avoiding interpretations, the performers themselves &#8211; at once detectives and mirrors &#8211; become, in essence, the messengers of kin. They are charged with the task of representing both so-called community and self in a stream of shadow, prop, and light&#8230;oh right, and performing for an audience.</p>
<p>Challenging the patterns categories afford us and the entitlement longer stays in cities dispense, such a piece (being careful not to boil anything in theater down to a play) is sure to encourage even more dichotomies. At least we have time and creative space to reflect upon them.</p>
<p>For a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcBZ7VnoVVU">theater threatened with closure</a> due to too much devotion to the &#8216;classic play&#8217;, all that comes after the crisis is a surprise and a step in the direction of survival, which may even grant it more courage for controversy.  English Theatre of Berlin, we are watching intently.</p>
<p><em>-by <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Tonight is the last night of the play, but tickets are still available <a href="http://www.reservix.de/off/login_check.php?id=c6ec16e8cf3cd5077514ebef590a1f763d4616b372ef8900411779bf6bedf213&amp;langID=2&amp;vID=10496&amp;eventGrpID=110522&amp;eventID=428332">here</a>! For more information on the theater&#8217;s dramatic threat of closure this past winter, see the <a href="http://www.exberliner.com/culture/stage/save-the-english-theatre/">ExBerliner&#8217;s critical article</a> on the matter and the reader comments it incited. Comments from yours truly are also to be seen. As an active participant in the campaign to save the institution, as a concessions volunteer for the past two years, and as a supporter of the good people who bring art (whether performance piece or classic play) to an international audience, I highly recommend seeing a show here just once. You will be glad you did. Tonight, I am in fact seeing this one and couldn&#8217;t be more excited <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it was the 1st grade. We were drawing pictures of our families and I carefully wrote <em>Mami</em> under the lopsided stick figure cast as my mother. A kid next to me leaned over and inspected my work. &#8220;That&#8217;s not how you write &#8216;Mommy&#8217;!&#8221; he squealed. &#8220;Yes it is!&#8221; I responded fiercely, confident that this was exactly how my <em>Mami</em> had taught me to spell it. Our teacher overheard the bickering and swooped in for the rescue. We were both right, she explained patiently. <em>Mami</em> was just &#8220;Mommy&#8221; in a different language.</p>
<p>That was the first time I can remember realizing that something about me was &#8220;different&#8221;. That I grew up with two languages, one of which was different than English. That I had more than one home, one of which was different than that of my classmates.</p>
<p>Growing up, I didn&#8217;t need a plane to travel from one home to another. There was my outside home, with school and friends and TGIF and snap bracelets and Rice Krispie Treats and all-you-can-eat buffets and pop culture references that I (mostly) understood. Then there was my inside home, where my mom confused the word &#8220;crush&#8221; with &#8220;crash&#8221;, we were told to put spit on our bug bites, summers were spent with my German grandparents instead of at camp, and Nutella was always king over peanut butter &amp; jelly. That&#8217;s the thing about transnationalism: It wasn&#8217;t just geography that marked the borders of my two homes. It was the words, the scents, the movements, and most of all, the people.</p>
<p><em>Transnationals are distinguished from migrants and immigrants because they are rooted in more than one country and culture. They are not simply &#8220;migrants&#8221; because they are categorized by more than temporary movement. They settle and become invested in the political, economical, and cultural patterns of their &#8220;host country&#8221;. But they are not simply &#8220;immigrants&#8221; either, because their movement is not primarily one-directional: they remain engaged elsewhere, maintaining connections, contributing to their &#8220;home&#8221; society, sending remittances (money), participating politically, etc.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-2.jpg" alt="photo 2" width="517" height="517" /></a></p>
<p>Of course there was the occasional collision of my homes. Usually they were trivial, like when I was gawked at in the middle school cafeteria for pulling <em>pâté</em> and baguette out of my lunchbox (à la &#8220;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&#8221;) or when I had to leave Friday school dances early because of Saturday German school. But sometimes they were bigger, like the handful of times I was called a &#8220;Nazi&#8221; or &#8220;German-Jewish-American-Princess&#8221; by classmates and when our parents decided to pull us out of high school and move to Germany for half a year.</p>
<p>Overall though, straddling my two homes was and remains relatively easy because my &#8220;differences&#8221; came across as interesting at best and weird at worst. They almost never held me back. Unlike many other children with immigrant backgrounds, I wasn&#8217;t so much switching between non-dominant and dominant culture as I was dominant-foreign (European) to dominant (upper-middle class white American). I didn&#8217;t struggle with English at school, my parents had no trouble helping me with my homework, and no one looked down on me for eating with fork in left hand and knife in right (except maybe when it was pizza).</p>
<p><em>Transnationals can also be identified as &#8220;cultural straddlers&#8221; who navigate life between multiple worlds. Anthropologists and sociologists call it &#8220;code-switching&#8221;, meaning their language, behavior, and mannerisms shift within different social contexts, depending on what is appropriate at what time and with which people (similarly to the way one acts differently at a job interview than at home with friends). Groups within the same nationality can also code-switch between different cultural identities that, based on historical and structural forces, have contributed to distinguished speech, capital, personal tastes, etc. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo 1" width="581" height="581" /></a></p>
<p>Now 28 years old and living &#8220;abroad&#8221; the past two years, I still navigate between my various identities with relative ease but my transnationalism has become markedly more pronounced. I switch regularly and fluently between two passports, two languages, even two sides of my wallet. With time, I find myself switching more seamlessly between health care systems, political processes, and workplace cultures.</p>
<p>But now an ocean more clearly demarcates my two homes and, no matter which side I&#8217;m on, keeps me away from people I care deeply about. That is the switch I find most difficult.</p>
<p>When I step into a plane heading east or west over the Atlantic, my mind begins to shift and retrieve minute details stored in the back of my mind. <em>Does the hairdresser also get a 20% tip?&#8230;</em> <em>Ach ja, store&#8217;s closed on Sundays, make sure to grab food tonight&#8230; Don&#8217;t forget to take your driver&#8217;s license when you go out, they&#8217;ll probably card you&#8230; German passport at EU control, American at immigration&#8230; </em>But deeper within me is a greater shift that pushes and pulls, twists and turns, fuels me with excitement and longing and sometimes sadness. It doesn&#8217;t present itself in clear or rational thoughts. It&#8217;s just present.</p>
<p>A week ago I sat in the plane, about to land in Washington D.C. for the first time in almost 10 months, staring down at my U.S. customs form. I had scribbled in my passport and flight numbers, the itemized list of chocolates and coffee I was carting over and their approximate value, thinking as usual about how all the Europeans in the plane were just expected to speak English and fill out the same form. Language obviously wasn&#8217;t my problem, but I was stuck nonetheless:</p>
<p><em>Please check one box: Visitor or Resident</em></p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t they get it? I&#8217;m always going away, and I&#8217;m always coming home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The age of migration is upon us. Human beings are mobile, in part due to the wonder of air travel, whose planes make relationship and imagination possible in spite of vast distances.</p>
<p>What social scientists deem a phenomenon, I call my lived reality. I collect toiletries in Ziploc baggies (an import) ready and loaded for the trips ‘home’ – a term, which we all know is ever ambiguous and relative. I transport chocolates and schnaps to loved ones on the other side, bringing back Trader Joe&#8217;s peanut butter and Pinot Noir to this side. I am heavily invested in both.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1459" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope.jpg?w=640" alt="window_collidoscope" width="512" height="682" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope.jpg 488w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope-225x300.jpg 225w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope-487x650.jpg 487w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<p>It might be confusing, but this dynamic – this swinging pendulum of belonging and longing through distance that depends on where you find yourself – is both challenging and beautiful. Out of this experience, we learn about the true weight of relationship beyond the convenience of proximity.</p>
<p>For going is about leaving, but it doesn’t have to be defined by it.</p>
<p><i>Berlin Tegel is quiet in the mornings, the terminals kept so tidy to hide even the most dramatic of goodbyes. It is 4am, and I am heading to Portland, Oregon via Amsterdam. Looking around, I am reminded of my first arrival back in 2010 with a plan only to study but no plan for where I would live, who would be my social support, or even how I should dress to avoid the look of the foreign (something now worth embracing). I stayed with the family of a girl I had met on the plane, whose father happened to be the chief of the Kreuzberg fire department, giving me my first introductory automotive tour in nothing other than a red fire engine. Now, cloaked in pre-dawn darkness, I lean into the arms of my biggest fan, saying goodbye in a language different from the one that will soon fill my mouth with memory, with a brevity different than that felt when pressed into the family members and friends I am to visit but cannot take with me.</i></p>
<p>Love, belonging, and connection do not dissipate in the process of journey or the reality of separation, neither are such feelings interchangeable depending on location. These feelings remain differentiated.</p>
<p>Because the comings and goings of life in transit are made material not purely by the wonder of air travel and the spaces which mediate it but by the destinations and origins on either side. Anthropologists emphasize the role of imagination and memory in unraveling and redrawing the lines and sensations of locations to which we feel connected. Put simply, we carry around images of &#8216;home&#8217;, &#8216;paradise&#8217;, &#8216;university&#8217;, &#8216;work&#8217;, &#8216;grandma’s&#8217; etc. with us, often in multiple representations, often in ever-changing quantities and with ever-changing qualities. Pink glasses with pineapple skewers, dreary winters full of long conversations near the sea. Umbrellas and the smell of moist newspapers, packed metro cars and cake-filled coffee dates. A stuffy airport with the smell of cigarettes and burnt espresso, a stuffy airport with the smell of mold and soy milk.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1436" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467.png?w=640" alt="Aviary Photo_130238137593380467" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467.png 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467-300x225.png 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467-650x487.png 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467-80x60.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><i>I</i><i> look at my luggage, marked with a name, a number, a house &#8211; somewhere that could very well be irrelevant to where I am going. In my mind, a feeling of moving, passing, changing – a sense of going. The airport cannot begin to represent this moment, one that has become central to my daily life, to the shape and activity of my social networks, even shaping my consumer decisions and the ways in which I do not invest in sets of towels or dishware. Even with the distraction of thought, I put my passport into the check-in machine, automatically flipping through the questions I have been asked on this same monitor now for the fourth time in two years. &#8220;What is my nationality?&#8221; &#8220;What is my country of residence?&#8221;, the differences here are key to the international system but not to mine. The German woman next to me enters the U.S. as &#8220;country of residence&#8221;, thinking that her trip to the United States validates her residency. I correct it in the computer for her, in order to speed up the line, though I wish to add that well&#8230;residency is complicated.</i></p>
<p>Airports might just be the perfect splice of how we navigate relationship. Position yourself for an hour on the curbside of Arrivals and you will see what I mean: airports are special for the human condition. We find ourselves gathered in establishments organizing such massive scales of movement, suspended in air, hurled gently across the ocean into the arms of those we love and those who love us. In hours, our imaginations and our longings are realized. As a result, we are inevitably pulled out of the arms of love, support, and belonging on one side, deferring to the other.</p>
<p><i>After a tight squeeze, the face that I always want to see turns to walk away. I am filled with emotion, a feeling I know I will have in just two weeks on my way of return – hugging my family goodbye and being overcome by their absence in seconds, by the weight of leaving, now for a second time in less than a month. Excitement and possibility tainted by a strange loneliness and fear. I look back to find his hand waving. Will his fingers be the same in 16 days, his voice? Will my father’s face have aged? My mother’s mind? I turn toward the security line, into the place I am going. Umbrellas and the smell of moist newspapers, dreary winters full of long conversations near the sea. </i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137800398147.png" alt="Aviary Photo_130238137800398147" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Going is a process of letting go (of my slight fear of flying, of my need to be ‘on call’, of my need to validate my relationships by constant contact). It involves packing – knowing I will return or want to bring back with me all kinds of transnational goodies and identity markers, like <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/Pubs">McMenamins</a> coasters. But more than anything, it is about coming into my imagination of this other home and preparing for what will be the task of leaving it.</p>
<p>As an hour in an airport would demonstrate, we migrate, we immigrate, we travel and tour, and thus, we leave someone and something behind. When we return, it is always with change: hairs lost on the other side of the ocean, water in the gut from different ground, dreams focused on the precipice of their mountains. Yet, relationships continue, reliant on a process of adaptation and connection that is not co-dependent on texting or casual coffee dates. And we are better for it.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1439" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318.png?w=640" alt="Aviary Photo_130238143157649318" width="640" height="384" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318.png 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318-300x180.png 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318-650x390.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>As a voluntary immigrant to a place in which my sense of belonging and connection has been entirely invented, I have learned this much: going is about letting go and embracing that, in the face of distance, our connections to each other are going to be ok.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bureaucracy is there to keep the rules in check, to decide who can be a part of the stacks of paper and benefits that make up either citizenship or the ominous category of legal (or illegal) residency status. Oftentimes, the line between these two categories is arbitrary, not reflective of individuals but of rules and their guardians. This is my story in a two-part lens about how blood and ink can define who you are in a city, how, as a German citizen, a ruler was used to cleanly draw a line in my passport across my former American city of residence, replacing it with a German one...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Alright, here we go: The </em>Bürgeramt <em>(resident service center), sometimes overlapping with the </em>Bezirksamt<em> (district bureau), houses the </em>Einwohnermeldeamt<em> (registration bureau) ((tired yet?)). It is here that all residents of Germany, citizen or otherwise, must legally register their address. </em><em>As a German citizen, I got to skip all the visa business and head straight to my district&#8217;s Bürgeramt to acquire my official forms and </em>Personalausweis<em> (ID card). This was back in November 2011. </em></p>
<p>A couple Google mapped turns and a 12 minute walk later and I&#8217;ve found it: an obtuse slab of grayish-white looming from across the <em>Hohenzollerndamm</em>,  its curving ends threatening to swallow me whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-640 aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/rathaus-wilmersdorf_tagesspiegel.jpg" alt="Rathaus Wilmersdorf_Tagesspiegel" width="480" height="360" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/rathaus-wilmersdorf_tagesspiegel.jpg 924w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/rathaus-wilmersdorf_tagesspiegel-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/rathaus-wilmersdorf_tagesspiegel-650x487.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/rathaus-wilmersdorf_tagesspiegel-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" />An arrangement of dark statues greets me as I near the entrance. Their distressed faces stare at me, mouths and eyes opened wide as if to warn,<em> </em>&#8220;get out while you can!&#8221; One is sprawled out on the ground, having seemingly given up altogether. It&#8217;s probably a memorial to a citizen&#8217;s uprising or something, but I can&#8217;t help but think this is some sort of sick joke. The Germans can&#8217;t be <em>that</em> ignorant of their reputation when it comes to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>A few good minutes trolling empty hallways on the wrong floor and I&#8217;ve found it. The first desk of three that I will encounter in the next 30 efficient minutes. Check-in, forms, wait. Rinse, repeat. (You will inevitably pick up the wrong form, miss your number being called, or head to the wrong room- a set of rolling eyes following you as you go.)</p>
<p>I am one of maybe five in the waiting room, which is both a relief and a privilege. This midday excursion is my biggest event of the day. Less than 2 weeks in Berlin and I am nicely settled in my family&#8217;s apartment with a printed letter from my <em>Opa </em>detailing our ownership tucked neatly into my German passport. My one-quarter of German blood is what makes all the difference between me and the squirming Middle Eastern looking couple hastily sorting their paperwork across from me. I carefully read over my single form, tripping over one or two questions that use the fancy German I didn&#8217;t grow up with. <em>Welche berufliche Tätigkeit üben Sie aus? </em>instead of <em>Was ist Ihr Job? </em>I cluck my tongue angrily at a question asking my religion, resisting the temptation to write something snarky. I know it&#8217;s for tax purposes, but it pisses me off anyway. I leave it blank.</p>
<p>My number flashes on the screen and I practically jump out of my seat, as if they&#8217;ll give up my spot within 30 seconds. The woman I&#8217;m assigned to is brusque but not unfriendly, and I try hard to speak my most proper German. It&#8217;s not like this mid-level bureaucrat has the power to take away my passport, but the irrational fear persists in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a bit confused by me and my occasional grammar mistake, but 5 or 6 stamps later and I&#8217;m free. She uses a ruler to cleanly draw a line through &#8220;Bethesda&#8221; and replace it with &#8220;Berlin&#8221;. As official as German bureaucracy is, at times it just seems like a game of Monopoly. Writing on a passport with a pen? Paying for my <em>Personalausweis</em> in cash? Where is my &#8220;Get Out of the Amt Free Card&#8221;?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-639 aligncenter" style="text-align: center;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/berlinerin.jpg" alt="Berlinerin" width="400" height="300" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/berlinerin.jpg 400w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/berlinerin-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/berlinerin-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Monopoly or not, I am now in possession of all the <em>Papierkram</em> I need for a legitimate life in Germany &#8211; in Berlin &#8211; in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf &#8211; in my apartment building &#8211; in that order. I am now rounding GO.</p>

<p>You may have heard of them. Zoe takes pictures of Ali while walking down the street and posts them on her tumblr called <a href="http://alioutfit.tumblr.com/">What Ali Wore</a>.</p>
<p>Her project has seen no shortage of attention. A few articles in <a href="http://www.mitteschoen.com/2013/03/25/der-etwas-andere-fashion-blog-what-ali-wore/">local</a> and <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/mediacenter/fotostrecken/berlin/fotoblog-what-ali-wore/8052528.html">national</a> German media, even some pieces by <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/29/living/what-ali-wore-tumblr">CNN</a> and a Turkish daily, and her followers went from 29 to more than 24,000. The trend of street style seems to catch the most attention; his outfits boast the irony of cosmopolitan contrasts: youthful pastels with a grayed moustache, prayer beads and a baseball cap, Kebab and a double-breasted plaid suit. Designers have even offered to send her clothing for Ali, she tells me &#8211; to dress Ali like a mannequin for a show. She declined, of course, she says a bit perturbed.</p>
<p>This is not just a fashion blog glorifying fabrics or cuts. A person and experience &#8211; positioned in the city and its landscape &#8211; exists behind the camera, behind Ali’s swagger. What beauty are we missing if we consider images simply for what they are, a blend of red polyester against a backdrop of hipsterdom? This is about Ali and Zoe and their well-timed collision. And it&#8217;s about gentrification. Most importantly, it&#8217;s about friendship.</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Zoe met Ali last summer while setting up furniture outside the Café where she works on Panierstraße, nestled in the booming heart of the Neukölln district. The scene is rough streets meet Williamsburg ten years ago. And ‘rough’ being the Berlin variety which is, well, mild. Like its American counterpart in Brooklyn, we discuss how the Café where she works and its environs have been the brunt of jokes, even legitimate public attack, as of late.<strong> Affluent expats, usually English-speaking, move in to transform the neighborhood with their record stores and crumpet Cafés, so goes the rhetoric, destroying tradition-culture-nostalgia-rent ceilings-jobs-diversity-etc. with one swift move of the fixie.</strong> She mentions a few articles and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeebmwdVskk">videos</a>, ones that also rush into my memory, clips or commentaries which chastise us (expats or the “new immigrants”) for simply coming and changing whatever it was that our clans were able to so rapidly and singularly change.</p>
<p>We talk about this gentrification discourse, how it somehow makes <em>Ausländerfeindlichkeit</em> (xenophobia) easier to stomach as just being <em>Anti-Gentrifizierung,</em> how it makes it ok to spit on those speaking English on the street or to hurl beer bottles from a moving car to those “talking American”. These events are close to both of us. They confound the destructive, unspoken impact of the anti-gentrification debate – <strong>the blame game that oversimplifies a capitalistic market to one facet of consumers.</strong> It is a game that assumes to know everyone’s reason for coming, for staying, and for interacting with the “locals”.</p>
<p>Animosity and stereotypes lead to fear, she tells me. Many businesses known to belong to expats in this part of Neukölln had been broken into around this time last year, windows smashed, even her café had been victim to minor altercations. But it is the fear, not the break-ins, that creates the most problems:  businesses owners labeled as “gentrifying expats” and nothing more feel pushed into a particular identity straight-jacket. M<em>any people began to blame the local [Turkish] community for the break-ins</em>, she says. This was just another group backed into a corner, youth without much to do, let alone an identity that did not come pre-packaged with a caution sign on one’s ID card. She knows how it feels, being put into a certain box. We all do.</p>
<p>Then one day, Ali walked by.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-461 aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg" alt="tumblr_ml1wf0itWm1rehyapo1_1280" width="448" height="672" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg 433w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></a><i>And it just happened organically, </i>she says. She noticed his well-put together outfits and slight swagger, asked to take his picture. Now it is a regular occurrence, though he prefers to have his picture taken only on days when he is looking snazzy&#8230;which are most days, it seems. He never leaves the house without an accessory &#8211; whether a jacket slung over the shoulder or colorful prayer beads, it represents his attitude, she says. He even began <em>to lean his shoulder back a bit in some of the photographs, working on his pose, </em>she adds with a grin.</p>
<p>There was probably a bit of intention in the first interaction, I add, <i>a connection you two shared from the start just by nature of positio</i>n. He, the assumed-<i>Gastarbeiter (</i>politically-charged term for &#8216;guest worker&#8217;) fighting against stereotypes and categorizations since arrival // she<em>,</em> the ex-pat fighting off armies of criticism for displacing the very people one considers to be neighbors: difficult situations that have arisen not out of  malice but out of circumstance, no matter the scale. She nods in agreement.</p>
<p>What began without much planning progressed effortlessly. As it turns out, they have a lot in common.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: a tenuous relationship to the German language. <i>My German is getting better because of Ali, she mentions enthusiastically. </i>She has continued to learn German slowly via Rosetta Stone, considering it a victory when she and Ali can communicate without too many halted sentences. <i>We can just communicate on basic terms, though he simplifies it down for me. </i>She laughs. <i>But I can pick out key words and we understand each other. </i>A journalist asked Zoe if Ali could speak any German. The woman <i>was surprised that he could, for his generation, at least</i>. <strong><em>He speaks German at a professional level in the shop, but he enjoys the practice with me too</em>, she adds with a smile.</strong></p>
<p>There are other similarities between the two, ones that the papers also aren’t writing about. <strong>Ali used to be a doctor in Turkey.</strong> He came to Germany as a young man seeking a better life 44 years ago &#8211; Ali is 84 years old &#8211; but found himself struggling amidst Germany’s incredibly strict immigration laws, which prevent the recognition of many accreditations achieved abroad (let alone their application in the job market). He was left an immigrant, a father &#8211; Ali has 18 children to date &#8211; without the ability to practice his profession or identity for that matter.</p>
<p>He learned the trade of tailoring, turning his white coat in for a pair of scissors. The bags seen in many of Zoe’s photos often contain his special tools, as he walks to work from his home in Neukölln<i>.<strong> I want to know why he didn’t go back</strong>,</i> <em>why he stayed,</em> she says. It is a struggle to stay, we both add. Working at a café is a step down, she explains, as she can’t afford the freelance insurance for personal reasons. <i>No one knows your story. They just make assumptions based on where they think you are from. </i>This cuts to the heart of the gentrification debate: assumptions without asking questions. And deciding to stay is a constant negotiation, I add, a constant weighing of pro&#8217;s, con&#8217;s, and dreams, even the dreams that can&#8217;t happen here.<a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-459 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg" alt="Ali_applepicking" width="358" height="538" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg 433w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /></a></p>
<p><i>Ali opens up so many doors to new experiences and opportunities</i>, she says<i>. <strong>Every time he sees me, he gives me a gift</strong></i>. This is how they first went to the apple orchards together – Ali had brought delicious apples into the Café for her; she inquired about their origin. Days later they were in the car heading to some distant field beyond Berlin to fill sacks with autumn’s fruit. She&#8217;s even attended a wedding with Ali, introduced her mother who was visiting from Australia. She often swings by his shop in the afternoons or meets him for lunch.</p>
<p>But it can&#8217;t all be apple-picking and weddings, and looming at the end of our uplifting and yet slightly sad conversation is the theme of our encounter:<strong> gentrification. <em>It is a problem</em></strong>, she reiterates, but pointing fingers at ad hoc identities without asking bigger questions isn’t finding a solution, either. It occurs to me that such encounters &#8211; like the one between Ali and Zoe &#8211;  aren&#8217;t happenstance, that even friendships between unlikely matches develop in such spaces of change and even crisis like this corner of Neukölln, especially in a city that has only known flux and adaptation to the times. Reaching out to each other in positions of out-of-placeness and marginality is more common place than we might think. <em><strong>These collisions are what keep us sane, humane, and humble. They prevent slight fissures from turning into chasms, allowing us to keep picking dem apples with neighbors quite different from our own biography.</strong></em></p>
<p>Ali and Zoe are going strawberry-picking this month. Zoe thought she would leave Berlin this spring. She’s staying a while longer, developing her friendship with Ali, and working on her photography. For now.</p>
