					<description><![CDATA[One attends a play about an Afro-German living in the years of Nazism and Jim Crow not because of the dramaturgy. One buys the ticket because of the topic's near absence in the German discourse. This is not a review of the play, but rather a continuation of the discussion with the cast that followed. As one of the cast-members remarked, it all comes down to audience: "Black folks probably wouldn't go to the theater to see this play in the U.S., let alone have enough money for the ticket. And here, we have a white audience. So, who are we really talking to here? Who is seeing this play?"...

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As a student of my own history and place in this world, nothing is more difficult for me than to write about issues of privilege, white-ness, black-ness, and justice in one sitting, because there is so much that can go wrong, so many terms that can be mis-used or mis-assigned, and so many truths that cannot be conveyed in one text. I have done my best. And with all my socio-anthropological know-how, I may still miss the point or offend, for which I am sorry: so is the nature of the subject.</em></p>
<p>One attends a play about an <em>Afrodeutscher* &#8211; </em>Afro-German &#8211; living in the years of Nazism and Jim Crow not because of the dramaturgy. One buys the ticket because of the topic, i.e. its novelty and near absence in the German discourse. &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221;, &#8220;Made Black&#8221;, at the <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/">English Theatre Berlin</a> explores the rich text of race in 1930s Berlin through the experience of Klaus, an unknowing Afro-German &#8211; a word that still spikes the air with rarity, German-ness still seen by many as a monopoly of the white-skinned.</p>
<p>But Klaus&#8217;s character and his experience of targeted exclusion are not that far from the present, as a conversation with the cast will demonstrate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_4.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht" width="640" height="1016" /></a></p>
<p>The play&#8217;s dense telling of a complicated history of race, citizenship, and post-colonialism through dialogue is impressive. Equally worthy of praise is the playwright&#8217;s collaboration with a well-versed historian.  The Afro-German actor, with a biography startlingly similar to the protagonist he portrays, is also seemingly extraordinary. The most important element, however, relates to its audience and what this means for theater as a medium of cultural critique.</p>
<p>This is not a review of the play, per se, on which the curtains closed this past Sunday. Rather, this is a review of the discussion with the cast, playwright, and director that came after, the sentiments of which will remain prominent and powerful in my mind, long after audience members have discarded their ticket stubs.</p>
<p><strong>The Conversation</strong></p>
<p>Thursday night, we, a primarily white audience, wait patiently for the cast to take their places at the foot of the stage. The protagonist of the play, the actor to play the American jazz musician, the actor to play the German politician, the playwright (Alexander Thomas), and the director file into folding chairs. <strong>&#8220;Black folks probably wouldn&#8217;t go to the theater to see this play in the U.S., let alone have enough money for the ticket. And here, we have a white audience. So, who are we really talking to here? Who is seeing this play?&#8221;</strong>, says the actor who plays the Black American musician &#8211; the play&#8217;s connective thread to Jim Crow.<strong> </strong>The scene seems to agree.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2259" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_3.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht theater cast" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Daniel Brunet, the mustached upstate New Yorker who produces the <a href="http://www.etberlin.de/producing-series/the-lab/">LAB series</a> for the English Theatre and directed this play, chimes in about the lack of representation of certain &#8220;communities&#8221; in cultural institutions. The problem of equitable, fair representation is something sure to resound for both American and German audiences, though certainly in different ways.</p>
<p>This problem is an old one. But it rattles and recalls Berlin&#8217;s more recent debates on multiculturalism, intercultural politics, and the integration &#8211; or just plain tolerance &#8211; of difference. &#8220;The topic of being German <em>and </em>of<em> </em>being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color">person of color</a> (p.o.c.) continues, often with little progress&#8221;, a p.o.c. from the audience remarks, a hint of a German accent in the throat. This topic is contemporary, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Can theater change these parameters? Can theater ask for more diversity from institutions that have no incentive to include them?</strong></p>
<p>The playwright, a Black American married to a white German woman, wrote &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221; as a way to process &#8220;the complexity of these issues&#8221;. And yet, as he makes perfectly clear, representing his own stereotypes of Germans and &#8220;the lack of place in [his] mind for an Other of color in Germany&#8221; is central to the play. &#8220;Otherwise, I would have been acting dishonestly&#8221;, he says, looking into the glare, behind which fragments of the audience, of us, must appear.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the play, himself an Afro-German, speaks, his English flooded with German vowels, his mannerisms oddly similar to his character, who re-asserts his German identity proudly throughout the play in deference to the Othering looks of those around him. This Other, created by the Black American writer, is somehow a reflection of himself, he states, admitting how through rehearsals he struggled to read his lines, even bursting into tears; how the first time he read the play, he felt personally implicated and stripped bare. <strong>&#8220;I am German, my father left when I was three years old, I grew up with my mother, was born in Hamburg, that is all I have ever known”</strong>, he says. The biographies are nearly identical, minus 80 years and a certain regime.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2311.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2255" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2311.jpg?w=640" alt="Schwarz gemacht stage" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The anger he enacts in the play now takes hold of his voice: the desperation and frustration. <strong>“Once I read the script I knew it had to be done, we had to make this play. Though, during intermission, when I was sprawled on the stage in a pile of paper [the stage is composed mainly of bundles and bundles of blank paper], I sometimes thought ‘what am I doing here, who am I talking to&#8217;”</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite these questions of audience and representation, the play successfully sends a message, one of critique. It weaves the complicated history of American segregation and its sub-human treatment of Blacks with the messianic framing of America&#8217;s involvement in WWII. Through the diverse arrangement of its characters, the play scrutinizes American moral authority in the fight against Nazi ideology and fascism, drawing dramatic attention to Jim Crow and the commonalities between racist ideologies.</p>
<p><strong>The parallels between American oppression and Nazi tyranny become painfully clear, eliciting the following question from the audience: &#8220;Would you show this play in America? And under what conditions?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We would just need a theater to show it&#8221;, the playwright says with a smile, confidently speaking for the work alone. &#8220;The play was actually meant for an American audience&#8221;, he adds, hence the translation of German passages and numerous references to American &#8216;race sciences&#8217;, details often omitted from textbooks. &#8220;This is a history of not only segregation but of a science [eugenics and race-based Social Darwinism] that many Americans do not know about&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such a truth of ignorance is reflected in the young woman in the play, who claims that the protagonist, Klaus, is not like &#8220;the other Negroes back home!&#8221;, though she has &#8220;never met one&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2258" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schwarz-gemacht_2.jpg?w=640" alt="colonialism Jim Crow" width="640" height="411" /></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Theater approaches many controversial political topics in the United States, because it can. A very particular demographic is going to the theater; and that is where such issues can be discussed&#8221;</strong>, Brunet adds.</p>
<p>The playwright explains that he is willing to relinquish artistic license and allow others to define the scope and boundaries of the play&#8217;s possible interpretations. Some scenes are based on his own childhood, others on historical research and collaboration with the author of <em><a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/174272/other_germans">Other Germans</a>, </em>Tina M. Campt<em>, </em>about being a person of African heritage in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is the point of the play?&#8221;, the jazz musician asks, perhaps to the audience, perhaps to no one present in this room. It is not about carving out identity from the crowd, asserting the value of the image in the attic mirror, but rather &#8220;about convincing society – the powerful – that exclusion is harmful and degrading to human beings. Now, and back then!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The point is, speaking truth to power&#8221;</strong>, he says, referencing, most notably, <a href="http://www.cornelwest.com/">Dr. Cornel West</a>, a giant in the continued civil rights movement for people of color, for the exploited lower classes.</p>
<p>Theater is not a dialogue with the masses, nor a dialogue with society in general, however. &#8220;Like cultural media and cultural politics, it is a dialogue with the powerful and their ideas&#8221;, says Brunet. The rest is some trickle down effect or, as the p.o.c. from the audience adds, &#8220;a change in consciousness&#8221;.</p>
<p>The camera man, a towering Black man with an equally large voice, speaks to the political or &#8220;transformative nature of the play&#8221;: <strong>“Most people ask themselves the question, are things really that different now? That is what this play does, it asks that question again of the powerful&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">With these words, I instantly feel implicated by my privilege, the things afforded to me on the basis of the position and body I was born into. The room shrinks. I shift in my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We are the audience. We are the ones who should see this play. We shape the discourse, often to the detriment of those who do not fit the desired mold. Theater might be a chance to reflect on <a href="http://www.taz.de/!116745/">critical whiteness</a>, even on its limitations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2296.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2250" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_2296.jpg?w=640" alt="English Theatre Berlin" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>One of the members of the cast remarks, perhaps to break a long 15 seconds of silence, <strong>&#8220;Can we imagine a black actor playing Romeo? A white actor playing Othello? Is it bad that we can&#8217;t?&#8221;</strong> For the sake of this question, &#8220;Schwarz gemacht&#8221; should be produced in another season, maybe in another city, as a voice in a room with too few listeners.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that it might be staged in the United States, a country, where diversity often means tolerating the one that is different but disrespecting him or her just the same. As <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/ta-nehisi-coates/">Ta-Nehisi-Coates</a> wrote in <em>The Atlantic</em> this Tuesday, <strong>&#8220;We are in America, where our absence of virtue is presumed, and we must eat disrespect in sight of our sons.<em> </em>And who can be mad in America? Racism is just the wind, here. Racism is but the rain.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p>*After the Nazi dust had cleared the German capital and West German society had taken root, the Black American poet and activist Audrey Lorde began to popularize the term <em>Afrodeutsche(r) </em>or Afro-German,<em> </em>during <a href="http://www.audrelorde-theberlinyears.com/">her years in the city</a>, effectively building a movement that at least gave a name to an almost invisible population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Berlin&#8217;s &#8220;problem district&#8221; to <a href="http://www.bz-berlin.de/aktuell/berlin/kreuzberg-teurer-als-charlottenburg-article1398469.html">more expensive</a> than <em>spießig</em> Charlottenburg: Kreuzberg&#8217;s made quite the transformation over the decades, but migration continues to shape its identity and reputation as a district.</p>
<p>The bulk of Kreuzberg&#8217;s diversity stems from the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s, when guest workers were recruited by West Germany to fill labor shortages after World War II*. Kreuzberg&#8217;s dilapidated housing became home to guest workers, primarily from Turkey. The district soon came to be known as &#8220;Little Istanbul&#8221;. In 2014 you would still be hard pressed to find a block without a <em>Döner</em> <em>Kebab </em>stand or five, but the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">district&#8217;s diversity</a> extends far past Anatolia.</p>
<p>Along with districts like Neukölln and Wedding, Kreuzberg is renowned for its <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/11/happy-weekend-its-not-about-integration-or-isnt-it/">immigrant integration</a> challenges that include low educational attainment and poor German language skills, high unemployment rates, crime and drug abuse, and gentrification. At the same time, the area has become increasingly attractive to <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/06/multiculturalism-diversity-and-the-big-city/">students</a>, hip expats, and young families. The result is a veritable array of nationalities, cuisines, houses of worship, and attires, as vivid as the graffiti gracing the walls of its gray housing and slender canals.</p>
<p>There are many popular spots in Kreuzberg, but the Maybachufer canal is perhaps one that most poignantly displays the cultural fusion that makes Kreuzberg a very special place to call home.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swans.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swans.jpg" alt="swans" width="594" height="594" /></a></p>
<p><strong>An Ode to the Maybachufer</strong></p>
<p>If I go away, I&#8217;ll remember the swans. And the walls of graffiti they floated along.</p>
<p>Rows of satellite dishes, speckled across gray concrete. Lingerers outside Kaiser&#8217;s, empty bottles at their feet.</p>
<p>Men huddled over pear-shaped glasses of Çay. Girls in tiny shorts and tights, snags in their thighs.</p>
<p>A market with only two rows, but infinite choice. Vendors calling &#8220;lecka! lecka!&#8221;, hints of somewhere else in their voice.</p>
<p>Hair smothered by scarves or impossibly fake dye. Individuals by words: &#8220;expat&#8221;, &#8220;immigrant&#8221;. You or I.</p>
<p>Where &#8220;German&#8221; ends and &#8220;other&#8221; begins, we futilely try to decide.</p>
<p>But the swans. They just keep floating by.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Sophia Burton</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The Maybachufer Turkish Market (U1-Kottbusser Tor or U8-Schoenleinstrasse) runs on Tuesdays and Fridays from approximately 12pm-6pm. Go for the cheap produce and spinach-cheese <em>Gözleme. </em><br />
</em></p>
<p>* West Germany recruited 14 million guest workers between 1955 and 1973 during the post World War II &#8220;economic miracle&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img_2302.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img_2302.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_2302" width="640" height="425" /></a>It&#8217;s not everyday you&#8217;re on TV, let alone get alluded to as a traitor by a host of public figures, including the Minister of the Treasury, all for being an expat. But both of these things happened to my friend and colleague Moran Yaheli when she was recently profiled in a TV report about Israelis living abroad.</p>
<p><em>We were on 4 episodes, there were 5 in total, and I&#8217;ve been on the morning talk show and the radio, </em>Moran recounts&#8230; <em>and I was told that a satire show used our part from the morning show. This Sunday I&#8217;m going to be on another morning show panel. I&#8217;m a Z-list celebrity!</em></p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll get back to that.</p>
<p>Moran moved to Berlin from Tel Aviv in 2011 after meeting her now fiancé, Bastiaan (Bas). Their story alone is a lesson in 21st century romances: they met on the online Couchsurfing platform, and Moran spent a few nights on Bas&#8217; couch in Amsterdam while traveling around Europe. After surviving a few months of long-distance Skype calls and the occasional visit, the two decided to make a home for themselves in Europe. They both found jobs in Berlin and now live together in the <em>Schöneberg</em> district. Last year they welcomed their first baby, a beautiful boy named Tommy.</p>

<p>Tommy is primed to grow up as what has been coined the Third Culture Kid (TCK): &#8220;a person who has spent a significant part of his or her developmental years outside their parents’ culture&#8221; (David Pollock). With an Israeli mother, Dutch father, childhood (or at least babyhood) in Germany, and frequent trips to both mother- and fatherlands, Tommy will grow up navigating at least three cultural codes, languages, and geographies. It may seem like an unusual life, but it&#8217;s more and more a norm in our increasingly globalized and interconnected world. Even Buzzfeed published an <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/31-signs-youre-a-third-culture-kid">article</a> on &#8220;signs you&#8217;re a TCK&#8221; that included swearing in multiple languages, time zone expertise, and a transient understanding of &#8220;home&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>Tommy is a child of combined cultures, </em>Moran reflects<em>&#8230; he has both an Israeli and Dutch passport&#8230; but even though he was born in Berlin he can&#8217;t be a German citizen (without giving up the Israeli one). It&#8217;s the same for me, I feel I have more than one &#8220;home&#8221;, and I guess he will have that, too.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1580" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg" alt="285679521_640" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/41264088">Source</a></p>
<p>With only 8 months behind him so far in this world, Tommy has already taken two lengthy trips to Tel Aviv and one to the Netherlands. He is a dual citizen and hears an average 2-4 languages per day: Hebrew from his mom, Dutch from his dad, German from his environment, and English, the language in which his parents communicate.</p>
<p><em>We want to do the OPOL method, &#8216;One Parent One Language&#8217;, have you heard of it? </em>Moran asks me.<em> That way he gets just Hebrew from me, just Dutch from Bas. Tommy&#8217;s baby noises are kind of both Hebrew and Dutch, he does a lot of the &#8220;Chhh&#8221; noise&#8230; </em>she giggles.<em> When the neighbor babysits he only speaks German with him. I want him to go to a bilingual Hebrew-German Kita </em>(child care center).</p>
<p>Tommy is not just (im)migrant, not just citizen, but somewhere in between. He was born and lives in Berlin but isn&#8217;t a German citizen. If he moves to either Israel or the Netherlands, he will be moving there as a citizen but won&#8217;t necessarily have grown up there. His diverse lineage, cross-cultural upbringing, and even his darker features may mean he carries the mark of <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/"><em>Migrationshintergrund</em></a> most of his life, whether in Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, or somewhere else. Tommy will &#8220;build relationships to all these cultures but perhaps never have full ownership of any&#8221;. TCKs often feel a stronger sense of belonging and connection to others who have a similar background rather than a particular one. When Tommy grows up, he may fall in love and marry another TCK, someone who grew up in Rome with Singaporean and British parents, or perhaps someone from Sydney with French and Brazilian parents. Studies say his chances of doing so are <a href="http://www.denizenmag.com/2011/09/infographic-the-modern-third-culture-kid/">1 in 4</a>. His future inclination to raise his children as TCKs? <a href="http://www.denizenmag.com/2011/09/infographic-the-modern-third-culture-kid/">Even higher</a>. His sense of home will be an abstract one, one that he feels more in relation to people, memories, and experiences than citizenship, borders, and geography.</p>
<p><em>I can&#8217;t vote in Israel because Israeli doesn&#8217;t allow absentee ballots&#8230; even my cousin </em>(in Israel)<em> doesn&#8217;t think I should be able to vote in their elections because I don&#8217;t live there, </em>Moran rolls her eyes.<em> But even though I don&#8217;t live in Israel, I still feel it&#8217;s my home&#8230; my friends and family are there. As for Tommy, he will have 3 homes for now and as he grows maybe just two- Israel which he will visit a lot, and Holland where he will likely live at some point. If we&#8217;re in Holland or Germany, I&#8217;m going to be seen as a foreigner. I don&#8217;t want Tommy to be made fun of or be ashamed of me. So it&#8217;s important for me that Tommy meets and grows up in an international environment, with kids who also have diverse backgrounds. With other kids like him.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-08-16-38-33.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-08-16-38-33.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-10-08 16.38.33" width="512" height="682" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Confusions and complications aside, studies on Third Culture Kids show that they reap a whole host of benefits from their intercultural upbringings and lifestyles: TCKs live in four countries during their lives on average, 85% speak two or more languages (47% speak three or more), and 90% earn a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree with 40% going on to further study. Statistically they&#8217;re a well-educated, well-rounded, and well-suited group for the demands of the 21st century, both professionally and personally. They just may have difficulty articulating to you <a href="http://vimeo.com/41264088">where home is</a>.</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t know where Tommy will end up, </em>considers Moran.<em> Right now the current situation in Israel is complicated and I can&#8217;t see us going back. Economically, politically, demographically, religiously, etc. But I am not giving up hope&#8230; Israel is a beautiful place, the best place, it&#8217;s just unfortunately in crisis. If things get better I would be on the first plane home. And, if the situation improves, I would love for Tommy to choose Israel, too.  </em></p>
<p>As to the economic situation&#8230;</p>
<p><em>The rising number of Orthodox Jews is scary and it is so expensive to live in Tel Aviv. I paid the same rent for a shoebox in Tel Aviv as I do now with Bas in our big, new flat in Berlin. Groceries are over twice as expensive in Israel than Germany!</em></p>
<p>126% more expensive in fact, which brings us back to the TV report. Grocery and rent costs were one topic Moran and a series of other Israeli expats were asked about when interviewed about living abroad. The economic situation in Israel is pretty dire and gave rise to the ongoing social justice protests that began in 2011, the largest in the country&#8217;s history with over 1 million people gathering in Tel Aviv&#8217;s Rabin Square. While mostly focused on the cost of living differences, Moran also got token questions about what it feels like to be a Jew in Germany. On the show, the journalist shuttles her over to the Holocaust Memorial to the Jews in <em>Mitte</em>. He&#8217;s curious how she feels when she sees it.</p>
<p><em>The Jewish Memorial doesn&#8217;t speak to me,</em> Moran explained first to the journalist and later to me. <em>It&#8217;s more the everyday. Like seeing trains covered in snow&#8230; we don&#8217;t have snow covered trains in Israel and it reminds me of images we saw in school of the deportation of the Jews. Or hearing the voice on the train say &#8216;</em>Ausstieg&#8217;<em> which always makes me think of &#8216;Auschwitz&#8217;. Seeing old people on the street and wondering what role they played in World War II.</em></p>
<p>And the Minister of the Treasury? When asked to respond to the TV report, he was in Budapest, giving a speech on antisemitism.</p>
<p><em>A word to all those who have &#8220;had it&#8221; and left for Europe&#8230; </em>Moran translates his response for me&#8230;<em> I&#8217;m here to deliver a speech in the Budapest Parliament about antisemitism, to remind them of how they tried to kill my father here only because Jewish people didn&#8217;t have their own land, how they did kill my grandfather in a camp, how they starved my uncles, how my grandmother was rescued at the last second from a &#8220;death march&#8221;. So excuse me if I&#8217;m a bit impatient with people who are willing to throw away the only homeland the Jewish people have ever had, just because Berlin is &#8220;more convenient&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Other politicians and one of the country&#8217;s most famous lawyers went so far as to call the Israeli expats in Berlin &#8220;traitors&#8221; and &#8220;slime that crawls in the sewer of Jewish society&#8221;, respectively. On the whole, however, Moran reports positive responses and understanding from those back in Israel, something she claims is a shift from the Zionist past.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s the older generation that has a problem with people leaving Israel&#8230; the ones who escaped antisemitism, built the country and died in wars to protect it, </em>Moran explains. <em>They see our leaving as abandoning the ship, the cause, the ideal&#8230; for money. My parents were born in Israel but my grandparents were from Europe, so I have two passports, too, </em><em>Israeli and Romanian. </em><em>I want Tommy to grow up with both tradition and choice&#8230; for his religion and for where he makes his home. </em></p>
<p>And choices he will have&#8230;</p>

Expats are good at constructing Germanness for the Germans themselves, often leaving out the Holocaust in such a description of 'German identity', however.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In 2005, Germany officially became an immigration country with the establishment of its federal office for migration (<a href="http://www.bamf.de/EN/Startseite/startseite-node.html">BAMF</a>). A wave of new laws and institutions were to follow, set to absorb those meant to stay &#8211; not just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter">guest-workers</a>, not temporary migrants, not <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertragsarbeiter">comrades</a> (so-called <em>Vertragsarbeiter</em> from communist countries), but immigrants. In turn, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/">German identity </a>has been shoved into the limelight. This country and its residents have witnessed plenty of change and adjustment, but redefining self and country after the fall of the Berlin Wall (even during the student <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_of_1968">protests of 1968</a>) had little to do with defining oneself in opposition to a foreign but stationary Other. Although individuals and families with non-German origins have been coming for centuries, confronting what will be an official change in what it means to be German is rather new, rather fresh.</p>
<div style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b038669g"><img loading="lazy" class=" " title="Justin Rowlatt and his wife Bee set out to live like a typical German family" src="http://images.dailyexpress.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/make-me-a-german-420020.jpg" alt="Justin-Rowlatt-and-his-wife-Bee-set-out-to-live-like-a-typical-German-family" width="590" height="350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Who are the Germans anyway? A BBC series answers this question by-doing</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">The question &#8211; who are the Germans anyway? &#8211; becomes increasingly important when deciding what to impart to newcomers. Which traditions deserve saving? What is important? The answers to these questions are not as simple as good bread or Hefeweizen. Expats with an outsider perspective are not shy in constructing simple &#8216;Germanness&#8217; for the Germans themselves. The BBC reality TV series &#8220;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/07/make-me-german-tv-review">Make Me a German</a>&#8221; plays with stereotypes and assumptions about what is <em>typisch deutsch</em> (typically German); the viral blog post <a href="http://www.uberlin.co.uk/what-i-know-about-germans/"><em>What I know about Germans </em></a>is just one example of trendy list-making of all things &#8216;German&#8217; by temporary residents; Berlin-based comedy writer <a href="http://adam-fletcher.co.uk/">Adam Fletcher</a> has created an entire <a href="http://store.hipstery.com/">brand</a> just based on the funny categorization of ‘Germanness’. On a tote bag in Fletcher’s line of nifty and hilarious merchandise: an engineer’s instruments, a watch, whole wheat, nude culture, asparagus. But where is the concentration camp in these lists, this series, or this fashion line? Where is the Holocaust?</p>
<div id="attachment_1362" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218225820494823.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1362" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1362" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218225820494823.png?w=640" alt="Aviary Photo_130218225820494823" width="512" height="682" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1362" class="wp-caption-text">Entrance to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, Oranienburg, DE</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">This past weekend, I embarked on a day-long tour of the former <a href="http://www.stiftung-bg.de/gums/en/index.htm">Sachsenhausen concentration camp</a> with a good friend here in Berlin &#8211; a friend, who just happens to be Jewish and originally from Ukraine.  We were a small group for an English speaking tour, minuscule in comparison to the masses of Italian and Spanish tour groups all heading to the same location. Two Taiwanese students, an American-Spanish couple on vacation from their residence in Saudi Arabia, a Brazilian student traveling Europe for the first time, a Bulgarian engineer, and Max and I (both Americans). We met our guide Alex, exchanged small talk, in part to find out why we all were willing to commit seven hours on a Sunday to hearing about tragedy, visiting the haunted, vast expanses of Sachsenhausen &#8211; a concentration camp just right on the edge of Berlin, reachable with the S-Bahn (public transit).</p>
<p dir="ltr">In contemporary political discussions about integration of immigrants into ‘German society’, no one claims that integration requires learning the lessons of the Holocaust. And yet, federal integration programs combined with international perception of Germanness say just that. The public concept of historical memorialization and its application, called <em>Vergangenheitsbewältigung, </em>is just as important to living in German society as <em>v</em><em>ollkorn Brötchen </em>or <em>Oktoberfest. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr">On our tour&#8217;s long walk from <a href="http://www.oranienburg.de/texte/seite.php?id=91511">Oranienburg</a> station to the gates of the camp, passing average-looking &#8216;German&#8217; homes with gardens neatly segregated from the street by high fences, I spoke with Natalia (the student from São Paulo) about Germany, the Germans, and the Holocaust. She brought up an interesting point: “How do the Germans feel about it &#8211; that people go to Venice to see the canals and to Berlin to see the Holocaust? I can imagine they don’t like it”. A man jogged past us in bright running-gear, his dog trotting behind him, just passing the entrance to the camp. This is part of being German &#8211; accepting that this is how you are seen in the world, that this history is an indivisible part of any sense of being German, it seemed.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218225935786183.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1363" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218225935786183.png?w=640" alt="Aviary Photo_130218225935786183" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">For new residents of Berlin, the past still matters and maybe even more than integration programs can provide for. My Ukrainian-American-Jewish friend Max (gotta love them hyphens) and his family left Kiev when he was five, in part due to Antisemitism. His great-great-grandparents were killed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_Yar">Babi Yar massacre</a> of 1941. The precarious relationship of the German government to its new status as an immigration country, let alone the way it classifies its non-German residents, is very much familiar to Max. &#8220;So, how does that make you feel as a Jew in Germany?&#8221;, I asked a bit sheepishly, recognizing the change of context from friendly chatter we usually entertain to rrrrrreal real fast. Many Jewish immigrants to Germany have likely heard this question before. “Antisemitism is more the exception than the rule. I don’t feel confronted by it in daily life&#8230;but I know it’s there”, he concluded. He is supportive of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Fascist_Action">Antifa</a> movements, aware that being Jewish in Germany is complicated but totally do-able, requiring a little finesse. Berlin, of course, has all kinds of finesse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our tour entered Sachsenhausen through the renovated watchtower and its metal gates, a construction bearing the architectural legacy of the post-war custodians of the camp and many others &#8211; the (East) German Democratic Republic. A stream of other visitors followed our trail, audio devices pressed to their ears. I felt strange, almost supportive of an odd form of tourism, securing Natalia&#8217;s comment about the connection of Holocaust tourism to German identity in reality.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3419" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_1302182256975699431.png" alt="aviary-photo_130218225697569943" width="606" height="606" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_1302182256975699431.png 606w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_1302182256975699431-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">A cacophony of languages could be heard as we moved from one monument within the camp to another &#8211; Swedish, Japanese, British English, French &#8211; all reading the same saddening information on plaques or biographical exhibition panels, all bearing witness to tragedy and an integral part (if not the deciding event) of this country&#8217;s history and present.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We moved to the far edge of the camp, heading toward the restored Barrack 38: the Jewish barrack turned memorial documentation center. As we entered the small structure, the smell of charred wood was unmistakable, paint peeling from the siding of the latrine and sleeping porch. Arson. In 1992, German identity was thrust under international limelight after reunification and the growing pains that followed, further exacerbated by the rise of Neonazism in the former East. Arson was a key expression of this tension. This same year of the attack on Barrack 38, Neonazis set fire to a refugee housing facility not too far from Berlin, terrorizing residents in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_of_Rostock-Lichtenhagen">riot of Rostock-Lichtenhagen</a>. The political activities of parties and movements, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Party_of_Germany">NPD</a> (German Nationalist Party with strong Neonazi ties), as well as the recent <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/topic/national_socialist_underground/">Neonazi terror-cell</a> and its string of xenophobic murders across Germany, point to a  contemporary relevance of the Nazi past to Germany’s future as a country of immigration. The Holocaust and its constitutive role in Germany identity has been part of the country&#8217;s historical development ever since. What to teach immigrants &#8211; remember the Holocaust.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3420" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218226423822983-650x487.png" alt="aviary-photo_130218226423822983" width="650" height="487" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218226423822983-650x487.png 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218226423822983-300x225.png 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218226423822983-80x60.png 80w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aviary-photo_130218226423822983.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">We left the camp in a drizzle of rain, boarding the S-Bahn back to Berlin. As our guide Alex (speaking a high variety of the King&#8217;s English) began to share an illustrative vignette about the end of the war and deterioration of Nazi moral power in Germany, passengers in the train appeared perturbed. A woman with fiery hair shook her head in disgust; she furled insults in German in our guide&#8217;s direction (understood only by me at the time). Another stern-faced German woman entered shortly after, raising her voice to replace that of the recently exited red-haired woman. Her lips quivering, she looked to be my mother’s age, the veins in her neck traumatically flinching, exposed. “Why don’t you just stop talking. It is rude what you are doing. It is not right what you are doing. We don’t need to be lectured to! You must stop&#8221;, she said abruptly in English.</p>
<p dir="ltr">German trains and buses are anything but loud, each keeping to his or herself in a very strong show of privacy. This may be a stereotype, but it illuminates the particular conflict that ensued quite well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With eyes closed in shock, our guide explained that we were on an educational tour of the concentration camp, that he had been doing this for years and had never had such a negative reaction. He kept calm and showed no sign of anger or distress. The female companion of the pulsing-veined woman responded loudly with perhaps the only words she knew: &#8220;shut uppp!&#8221;, popping the &#8216;p&#8217; just at the end.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My friend Max intervened &#8211; asked our guide to have a seat, standing to allow him to do so. With hands shaking and eyes kept closed, Alex continued his narrative: the time after the war, the protests of 1968, de-Nazification in educational and political institutions, current movements of young people, general skepticism toward patriotism in Germany ever since &#8211; all forming parts of a whole history that has never really come to a close.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As we exited the train, the pulsing-veined woman ran to Alex, extending her hand to graze his: &#8220;I agree with everything you said!&#8221;, she said, &#8220;but you were just speaking so loud for a public place! It is a train, not a classroom. Your voice was really just too loud for all of us, so for next time, just speak quieter.&#8221; She paused, Alex thanked her. And then with one last quiver of the lip: &#8220;I was one of those Germans you talked about, one of those students with guilt for something I wasn&#8217;t even old enough to have participated in. So thank you for what you said&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I don’t want anyone thinking ‘oh these horrible Germans’. I don’t want you all leaving thinking that,&#8221; the woman added as we had nearly let the train doors shut behind us, her eyes directed at all of us in a show of penetrating honesty. Education about the past does more than just memorialize or prevent reoccurrence: it avoids essentialization of historical events and preserves the complexity of it all.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With the new immigration status of 2005 and the integration programs that followed, came the creation of an <a href="http://www.bamf.de/EN/Willkommen/DeutschLernen/Integrationskurse/InhaltAblauf/inhaltablauf-node.html">&#8216;integration curriculum&#8217;</a>, including cultural orientation that included this very facet of Germanness: the Holocaust. Immigrants participating in the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/18/review-become-a-german/">integration courses </a>visit historical institutions designed to communicate the significance of the Nazi period for Germany as both a modern state and as a group of transnational or transethnic individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Official curriculum including Holocaust field-trips doesn&#8217;t answer all questions, however. Politicians are still scratching their heads at the &#8216;German question&#8217; &#8211; each party choosing which elements it wants to claim for the imagined &#8216;nation&#8217;, some famously campaigning for a <em>Leitkultur (</em>one central guiding culture for Germany by Germans). Such a sentiment has been heavily criticized by most politicians outside of the leading conservative party (CDU), including the head of the Jewish Council of Germany, Paul Spiegel. In a speech to Parliament, Spiegel said <em><a href="http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/leitkultur---die-scharfe-kritik-von-paul-spiegel-am--verbalen-zuendeln-der-politiker--hat-die-union-aufgeschreckt--der-bundesrat-stimmte-dem-antrag-auf-ein-verbot-der-rechtsextremen-npd-zu--merz-versuchte-zu-intervenieren,10810590,9851008.html">&#8220;Ist es etwa deutsche Leitkultur, Fremde zu jagen, Synagogen anzuzünden, Obdachlose zu töten?&#8221;</a>, &#8220;is it &#8216;German culture&#8217; to hunt down foreigners, to light synagogues on fire, to kill the homeless</em>?&#8221; The Holocaust is not far from these debates about Germanness, thus it is no wonder that it is included at least in educational programs to include newcomers in German society.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today&#8217;s Germany &#8211; an immigration country &#8211; is a republic built on tragic events like the Holocaust, just as France is a country built on colonialism. This is not to say that countries and their residents are reducible to history. Rather it is to say that institutions and individuals are still intimately connected to what came before. It is about understanding how one can relate to such a history in its contemporary place, shaping either collective guilt or political activism (in the likes of Antifa) just the same. Everything has a context, and it is this context that immigrants to Germany should learn to understand for the sake of a more complete country &#8211; a civic society which respects differences and celebrates them. For Germany is not just for those who were once classified as &#8216;ethnically German&#8217;, it is for anyone that chooses to reside in Germany. Becoming German* is understanding history and what it might mean for the present, regardless of ethnicity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Berlin can be a historical mine field. Escaping the fact that genocide, division, tyranny, even the colonial division of Africa began on this ground is an impossible feat. As American tourists wander through the many memorials to the lost, murdered, and persecuted that saturate the city with this remembrance of tragedy, I have to ask myself: Do we Americans think that we were always the “good guys” in this mess?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.kinocast.net/wp-content/uploads/Kinocast/Inglorious_Basterds2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Germany may have a particularly difficult past, but the catastrophes of the 21<sup>st</sup> century &#8211; and the ill which permeate them &#8211; were in no form a European phenomenon, let alone a product of everyone’s favorite enemy: Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. American mythos about WWII would like to position a liberating force of Justice against a tyrannical force of Evil (usually inaccurately embodied by one Charlie Chaplin-mustache-wearing leader doing a special kind of rigid salute). Villains of this type, the kind meant for blockbuster films and theatrical reenactments, often detract from the other kind of villain &#8211; our own. Demonizing Germany as the dramatically viscous perpetrator can detract from the other transatlantic evil-dooers, namely, those who held other human beings of darker skin in socioeconomic captivity for centuries (see the <a href="http://newjimcrow.com/">New Jim Crow</a> for its present manifestations). No other history of slavery, segregation, and integration is as dynamic and disgusting as the American story. And yet, Nazi Germany steals the show; the Americans arrive with massive tanks and candy for children; evil is blighted out with a swift hand of justice and freedom&#8230;so goes the myth of the &#8220;good guys&#8221;. And so this myth must be, once again, popped.</p>
<p>I know just the documentary to do it &#8211; <em>Arte&#8217;s </em>&#8220;<a href="http://videos.arte.tv/de/videos/brown-babies--7526612.html">Brown Babies</a>&#8221; in German or its English counterpart &#8220;<a href="http://brownbabiesproject.com/">The Mischlingskinder Story</a>&#8220;. I watched &#8220;Brown Babies&#8221; on <em>Arte </em>this past Thursday. Here are some scenes, impressions, maybe even a splash of critique. Most importantly, here is a snapshot of an oft-forgotten part of history, giving America&#8217;s good-guy image a run for its money.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><em>A 50-something black man with slight European features,  hair combed back into waves, drives a tractor through the wheat fields of a farm just outside Washington D.C. He uses the back of his hand to wipe sweat from his eyes. In those eyes is nothing but wandering, the search for self and whatever comfort the solidification of one’s biography might provide.</em></p>
<p>He is one of more than 100,000 so-called <em>Besatzungskinder</em>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_children">War children</a>, born shortly after WWII to a German mother and an American father, a soldier, stationed on temporary duty in post-war Germany, when the country, especially Berlin, was divided into strict military zones. Dan belongs to smaller sub-set within this statistic, a sub-set not so often discussed. Dan is black, well mulatto…well he isn’t sure, and in the 1950s, neither Germany nor the United States saw him as ‘integratable’, rather as “racially problematic”. Germany suggested the return of such children to their &#8216;origins&#8217;, that is, to families with similar &#8216;racial&#8217; composition. America accepted such children under the pretense of segregation &#8211; they would be kept out of white public places, situated in families of their own kind. And all this <em>after </em>the Holocaust, after the scandal of rejected Jewish refugees from American shores leading up to the genocide, all this after moral imperatives were touted as reasons to enter to the war.</p>
<p>And so in 1951, shipments of darker-skinned children began, sent to strangers in a land which forbid them most basic rights. 7,000 of these so-called brown babies were adopted by families in the United States, almost exclusively into African-American families, as Jim Crow and general trends within the Union would dictate. Their German mothers gave them up for many reasons, often rooted in a combination of state and community pressure to rid society of un-integratable elements. The United States took them in officially, but did little to ensure their well-being, ensuring rather their subjection to segregation.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wanda-lynn.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-725 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wanda-lynn.jpg" alt="Rosemarie Pena" width="640" height="459" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wanda-lynn.jpg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wanda-lynn-300x215.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wanda-lynn-650x466.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>In the 1950s, shipping half-white, half-black children to African-American families was a political act and often a dangerous one. Civil Rights protests were just beginning to take root in student communities, church congregations, workers’ strikes; the pavement of Montgomery and even Chicago were already tainted with the blood of black Americans and the rubber bullets of an oppressive state. Many of these children were put into the American South, but even in the North, racial discrimination was social custom even if it wasn&#8217;t outright law. It was in 1955 that Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus, unleashing lynchings and riots across the South. In this same year the corpse of young <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/till/">Emmit Till</a> was found flogged and bloated in a river of impunity. Into this oppression and brewing revolution young children speaking only German, the language of the former enemy, arrived, hearing the term <em>Kraut </em>for the very first time, often followed by N***** or Negro. Quite confusing nomenclature for a confusing situation!</p>
<p><em>“We did not choose to be a part of a movement. But living in the black family I was in, I had to participate”, Dan describes. His parents took in many other “brown babies”. But not as an act of charity, rather as an economic calculation with a full farm to run, he tells the camera. European-black children did not share the history of the ‘freed’ slaves. The movement felt foreign to him; his family estranged.</em></p>
<p><em>Peggy, also in her late 50s, decides to track down her biological mother in Germany. She flies to Karlsruhe, finds herself wandering among clean cobble-stone streets, searching for the small graveyard where her mother is buried. She pulls weeds away from the headstone, planted in an untended cemetery in 1992 &#8211; she waited too long. </em></p>
<p><em>Peggy seeks relatives, rings the apartment building of her biological sister, clutching papers with information of living and deceased family members. It is amazing what the internet can provide. A small blonde-haired woman opens the door, shocked as Peggy explains their relation. The encounter in the apartment is quaint, even restrained. Peggy sits with a Lakers baseball cap and a &#8220;USA&#8221; T-shirt, her hands nervously folded in her hap. She asks for photos. </em><em>“You look like her”; “your father is Peurto Rican”; “she just didn’t want kids; she would rather go dancing than stay home with the children”. A niece visiting from American conveniently interprets. </em></p>
<p>The other 4 stories of unwanted birth, migration, adoption, black or multiracial identity in the United States dash across the screen. Stories of the falsified Afro in a time in which hair was political, vignettes  of a childhood growing up in families struggling to identify themselves as revolutionaries, subservient, fighters, blacks, or former slaves, Afro-German-American children asking too many questions about their own lighter skin color, getting often in the middle of fights, hearing the repeated “you are lucky I took you in”.</p>
<p>Germany and the United States are two very different countries compared to their pasts – both dealing with racism publicly and productive, though there is much to be done. The project is just beginning. Part of a complete <em>Vergangenheitsbewältigung </em>(German for confronting or even overcoming the past) is recognizing times of complicity and complacency, integrating these moments of ethical weakness within our teaching and reproduction of historical narratives. For the stories we tell of ourselves are only as true as the breadth of their inclusion. Until this point, WWII narratives have heroized Americans as Liberators and Germans as evil-dooers. Within the greater spectrum of historical experience, America continued to inhumanely repress its ethnic minorities, long after the tragedy of Auschwitz was unleashed. What does this say about America? And what does this say about the good guys?</p>
<p>What cannot be explained in a documentary is the complexity and variation in experience between regions of the United States, family dynamics, configurations of urban versus rural upbringing, and even color-based hierarchies within American black communities. The German documentary could have spent a few more minutes devoted to these differences and what cannot be examined, even made sense of within the pictured narratives. &#8220;Brown Babies&#8221; comes highly recommended, despite its inability to make all complexity of a generation and a movement accessible. It can be moved anytime from <a href="http://videos.arte.tv/de/videos#/tv/coverflow///1/120/"><em>Arte</em></a>&#8216;s Mediathek.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">When I posted the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/14/rant-whoswhose-normal/">Who&#8217;s/Whose Normal?</a> article a few weeks ago, I expected the &#8220;N-word&#8221; of interest to be<em> Neger</em>, a term that falls somewhere between &#8220;negro&#8221; and &#8220;nigger&#8221; on the translation and offensiveness spectrum. Instead, the strongest reactions came in response to another N-Word: Nazi.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thenword.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-756" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thenword.png" alt="thenword" width="546" height="366" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For those who haven&#8217;t read the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/14/rant-whoswhose-normal/">original post</a>, the controversy stemmed from a comparison I made between a Berlin storefront poster campaign and Nazi propaganda (on an aesthetic &#8211; not political &#8211; basis). On second thought, I shouldn&#8217;t put that last bit in parentheses, because it&#8217;s the essence of my point. Despite Berlin being <strong>Germany&#8217;s most ethnically and culturally diverse city</strong>, these particular <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-11-09-35-05.jpg">storefront posters</a> feature <em>only</em> heterosexual Caucasian families. On an aesthetic basis (skin tone, facial features, body build), they don&#8217;t differ much from the fair blond couples on Nazi posters. A couple brunettes are included here or there, but I don&#8217;t consider that diversity. The bad man himself was a brunette, no? That&#8217;s probably not going to make me any friends either.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While I am in no way comparing the people from this store to Nazis (I repeat: in no way!), I was disappointed by these posters and the message they send. On multiple posters and within an <a href="http://www.leiser.de/frontend/startseite.htm">entire website</a>, I find it disconcerting to see only one type of ethnicity, sexuality, and idea of beauty. And both creative process scenarios &#8211; whether <em>Leiser</em> consciously made this decision or didn&#8217;t realize that this is what they were doing &#8211; are also disconcerting.</p>
<p>Although many agreed with me that the images were problematic, my Nazi comparison was not as well-received. In the spirit of promoting discourse and &#8220;seeing things from every lens&#8221;, I thought it critical to share a selection of these reactions. Disclaimer: All German comments have been loosely translated by yours truly.</p>
<p><strong>German Commenter 1:</strong> In the U.S., you use the term &#8220;Nazi&#8221; as a joke, e.g. &#8220;You&#8217;re a cleaning Nazi&#8221;, just like we say the term <em>Negerküss</em> [Nigger-kiss]. Neither group considers the history and context of the other. In Germany, we only call really evil and abominable people Nazis, people who seem to be OK with what the Nazis did. It is the worst insult you can give someone. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a hard pill for me to swallow when &#8220;normal&#8221; people (even if they are racist or discriminatory) are compared with Nazis, just like it is hard for Americans when they hear us use the term <em>Neger</em>.</p>
<p><strong>German Commenter 2:</strong> Sophia, you have to be really careful with the use of the term &#8220;Nazi&#8221;. Your comparison [of the storefront posters] to Nazi propaganda goes too far. Germans have a total complex when it comes to our history and you can&#8217;t just make that sort of comparison. As an American, you can&#8217;t understand how hard it is growing up with this history&#8230; You&#8217;re not exactly going to make friends with this sort of comparison.</p>
<p><strong>German/American Commenter in response to above:</strong> Is being critical un-German? Isn&#8217;t that how the Germans got into the Nazi/Holocaust mess to begin with?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>American Commenter in response to above:</strong> Oh my god! Do these people seriously believe that anti-black racism is the same as calling someone &#8220;a cleaning Nazi&#8221;?? And that you can&#8217;t possibly understand that because you didn&#8217;t grow up there? WTF! I&#8217;m not jumping in because I don&#8217;t want to hijack a thread and you&#8217;re being much more diplomatic than I would be, but dude! What the hell!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yikes.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-767 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yikes.jpg" alt="yikes" width="592" height="437" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yikes.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yikes-300x221.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yikes-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a><strong>Me after reading the comments</strong></p>
<p>What these comments have made clear is that context is paramount in the interpretation of language. Perhaps more importantly, however, it has made clear that one shouldn&#8217;t limit themselves to only their immediate context. We can&#8217;t always dissect every word to see if it may offend someone, but we should be more mindful of the political, cultural, and historical contexts of other groups when using potentially hurtful language.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve often heard that Americans are more PC (politically-correct) than Europeans. Yet, this discussion has shown me that that is not necessarily the case. All nations have sore spots in their histories &#8211; some more recent than others, some that should be sorer than they seem to be &#8211; where we need to tread lightly. We also handle these sensitive topics differently. There&#8217;s still no slavery memorial in Washington, DC, but the German capital is laden with memorials and museums acknowledging their &#8220;black mark on history&#8221;. Americans are known for being the kings (&amp; queens!) of PC language, but the Germans actually came up with a dictionary of Nazi terms to promote awareness of their use.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Yes, the Germans have a word for &#8220;coming to terms with the past&#8221;: <em>Vergangenheitsbewältigung.</em> <em>Vergangenheit</em> simply means &#8220;the past&#8221;, but <em>bewältigen </em>can translate to several verbs, including &#8220;to overcome&#8221;<em>. </em><strong>What does it mean &#8211; as nations and people -to overcome difficult periods in our history?</strong> Does it mean erecting public memorials and monuments? Does it mean holding companies responsible for the images that they portray and promote? Does it mean never using the &#8220;N-word&#8221; or, alternately, being able to use it as a joke? I&#8217;m all ears and mindful speech.</p>
