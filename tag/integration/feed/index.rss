<p>The new <em>Integrationsgesetz </em>mandates fulfillment of a German principle of social and economic assimilation. This principle has little precedent, in terms of a comprehensive law. There have been expectations and additions to existing legislation in the past, but never has there been governmental action specifically devoted to the question of whether or not newcomers have found ways to fit in. And never has this governmental action been tied to sanctions, if benchmarks and timelines aren&#8217;t met.</p>
<p>The new law measures the ability of newcomers to fare well on the basis of language and employment, with respect to natives: They are to learn German, well, within 5 years and become economically self-sufficient as soon as possible. Welfare and other subsidies are tethered to employment programs. Specific to refugees, asylum applicants awaiting refugee status will be recruited for low-paying (1 euro/hour) jobs as soon as they are registered with the authorities, no matter the qualifications they bring with them from their home countries.</p>
<p>This approach is known as the welfare-to-work model, popularized by the Clinton administration in the U.S. and implemented in Germany since 2002 in the form of the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/thema/arbeitslosengeld_ii/">Hartz-IV</a> reforms. <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/magic-bureaucrat-riverside-miracle/">Research has shown</a> that welfare-to-work programs, rather than re-training newcomers or supporting them while they seek jobs for which they are actually qualified, have serious long-term consequences. Stagnation and even regression is the word.</p>
<p>The integration law presupposes and, indeed, requires a &#8220;help yourself&#8221; attitude. This was precisely the message of the German austerity program of Hartz-IV, forever unpopular among the Left. This correlation between the new integration program and austerity language has led some members of German Parliament to send up flares.</p>
<p>The economist and Green Party representative Brigitte Pothmar <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/integrationsgesetz-127.html">criticized the intent and scope</a> of the law specifically on the point of low-wage jobs: &#8220;According to its supporters&#8217; own language, the legislature plans to spend 3 million euros on ridding refugees of boredom. But refugees don&#8217;t need occupational therapy. They want to learn and they want to actually get to work!&#8221;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/integrationsgesetz-127.html">similar critique was wielded </a>by the Left Party representative Sabine Zimmerman, calling the law exclusionary at best. In terms of the economy, in particular, &#8220;This type of work [1 euro jobs] does not provide any opportunity to earn qualifications or to truly learn the language. In effect, it makes it even harder for real opportunities to come about.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it is not only the language of self-help and the threat of stagnation that these parliamentary representatives are worried about. If newcomers are unable to reach German proficiency in 5 years&#8217; time or are unable to maintain employment, residency permits will not be renewed or will be outright denied. Other sanctions, such as restrictions on housing and overall mobility, also apply.</p>
<p>Likewise, those who prove to be &#8220;exceptionally well integrated,&#8221; according to the law&#8217;s system of measurement, will be granted the privilege of ungarnered residency within 5 years. There is a carrot at the end of the integration stick. And it looks a lot like survival.</p>
<p>The media&#8217;s response to the new integration law, as well as that of practitioners in the field, has been swift and strident, criticizing the way in which the word &#8220;integration&#8221; is tied to fundamentals like housing and residency permits. The well-respected German weekly <em>die Zeit </em><a href="http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-05/integrationsgesetz-fluechtlinge-wohnsitz-parlament-meseberg">reported the law&#8217;s final drafting</a> with the headline &#8220;Work better, fail quicker.&#8221; Another well-respected paper, the daily <em>Süddeutsche Zeitung</em>, printed the news with the headline &#8220;An integration law that doesn&#8217;t deserve its name.&#8221;</p>
<p>This new law does intend to simplify and expedite the processing of the many asylum applications Germany continues to receive. For many of the law&#8217;s opponents, this addition of asylum proceeding reform was reason enough to support the law. Yet it may be more restrictive than helpful to those applying for asylum. The <a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article156905294/Unter-einer-Bedingung-koennen-abgelehnte-Asylbewerber-bleiben.html">headline provided by the right-leaning daily</a> <em>die Welt </em>for the new law is telling: &#8220;Asylum-seekers can stay only under one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Value Judgement</strong></p>
<p>What does this have to do with the title of this article, the value of a foreign life?</p>
<p>Any subject of law, citizen or not, is assigned a particular value, as reflected in and by society. Law most often protects the value of the universal person in that it prevents harm and injustice within the scope of its jurisdiction, no matter the origin of said person. Natives cannot kill tourists or undocumented migrants, for example. This is still a crime.</p>
<p>But this goes both ways. Law is discerning, as are its makers. It can decide when and if certain protections or privileges are granted. In this act of exercising certain judgment, determining who is the recipient and who is not, a value judgement is passed. In the case of Germany&#8217;s new and unprecedented integration law, those who become German in the ways the law prescribes have value enough to stay. Those who fall short do not.</p>
<p>This value judgement is apparent in the language of the law itself, as well as in discussions surrounding it. One example is the usage of the word &#8220;<em>i</em><em>ntegrationsunwillig</em>&#8220;, meaning &#8220;unwilling to integrate.&#8221; Its counterpart, a noun, is <em>Integrationsverweigerung</em>, which takes a stronger tone: It means &#8220;refusal to integrate.&#8221; The subjects who exhibit these traits become subject to the sanctions mentioned above, likely to eventual deportation, thus forfeiture of assets, professional networks, and personal relationships in Germany.</p>
<p>This language makes clear assumptions about intent and character far more than it does about simply the state of things, of whether or not an individual has found him/_/herself to belong in their new home. &#8220;Unwilling&#8221; implies a flouting of both convention and the laws of the land. Cultural difference becomes cultural deviance within this frame, and those who do not fit in effectively become criminals.</p>
<p>The perceived understanding of integration behind this language of &#8220;unwilling&#8221; is most problematic in that it devalues the experience of the newcomer and abdicates the native of certain responsibilities by way of this process.</p>
<p>In other words, what of the many natives who will refuse to grant newcomers a job because of their last name, because of their fear of ISIS or simply of Islam?</p>
<p>What of the slow-moving bureaucracy that will prevent timely and efficient completion of an integration course, or of the notoriously unfriendly bureaucrats who will make registration for state-subsidized language courses or other training programs a painful and humiliating process?</p>
<p>Will the other side, at any point in this hypothetical pathway to official integration, be charged with an unwilling and outright difficult attitude?</p>
<p>The law, by default of its creation, values natives above foreigners. The answers to all the above questions will tend to err on the side of the native for this reason, and responsibility will continue to be a weight born by the weakest, the least valued. These are the immigrants, the asylum-seekers, and the refugees of today.</p>
<p>Germany has done so much good for the refugees of the world in this past year. This new law is an unfortunate development.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the integration law negates the complexity of human behavior and the ways in which human beings tend to respond to mechanisms of control. It is unfortunate that it transforms a once two-way street into a narrow, one-way turnpike, failing to recognize that tying belonging to an existential crisis is one sure way to create another type of crisis, one of protracted isolation and despair. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Way Out</strong></p>
<p>One does not become a part of a group by the force of policy, nor does one come to belong anywhere by resigning to segregation and the apathy of staying apart.</p>
<p>But I for one would rarely speak to my German neighbors if I didn&#8217;t feel that they would smile at me and wish to speak back. I am too sensitive of feeling unwanted and merely tolerated to make myself so vulnerable. In a similar way, if I were just learning German, I would rarely try to order in German on a busy bakery morning. I would rarely try to ask any questions of the service personnel at the mall. I would be too afraid of looking and feeling defeated for the stern face, the impatient twitch, and the impolite interruption that often peppers such interactions with shame.</p>
<p>And if I cannot imagine doing these things, as someone with no experience of war or traumatic displacement, I cannot imagine it for all newcomers from Syria and elsewhere &#8211; human beings who have suffered the extremes of suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Laws may not be made for empathetic social responses, but norms are. In response to this new law, a little normative empathy is in order. Perhaps it is time not for sanctions but for a new German way of being with each other.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Small gestures like the prolific smile, like deferring to others in line at the grocery store, like trying (only trying!) to give directions in English, like waiting patiently for a German-learner to get out their form of a German sentence, will bring the empathy this law is so clearly lacking. If this happens, Syrians and Afghans and Eritreans and Kurds (etc) are made to feel that they are also people of value.</p>
<p>For anthropologists and sociologists, value is a social construct. It does not exist inherent to things, to substance. Rather it is made within a system of prioritizing this, disregarding that, supporting the success of this and punishing the success of that. Value is a trait or state to be expressed through norms, such as everyday behavior, as well as structures, such as divisions of labor or the segmentation of achievement within public schools*. It is a process, not a prescription.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see soon enough if the process can rise above this law.</p>
<p>&#8211;<em>By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p>*For more on this critical view of how and why value is created in society, see the well-known work of anthropologist David Graeber on the topic, available as a PDF <a href="https://monoskop.org/File:Graeber_David_Toward_an_Anthropological_Theory_of_Value.pdf">here</a>. You will never see prices and social priorities the same!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of Germany&#8217;s World Cup victory, much has been said about a renewed sense of German patriotism and its implications. While some have feared a connection to Germany&#8217;s dark past, others have welcomed the discourse as a chance to shape a new sense of belonging within the country&#8217;s evolving demographics. We&#8217;ve already written something about it <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2014/07/28/world-cup-fever-how-malleable-is-german-identity/">here</a>. But what a discussion on national identity means on the personal level is another story. Or rather many stories. Here&#8217;s one.</p>
<div id="attachment_3184" style="width: 439px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3184" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3184 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ali.jpg" alt="Ali für Deutschland " width="429" height="429" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ali.jpg 429w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ali-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3184" class="wp-caption-text">Ali at the Germany-France game at Train Cocktailbar</p></div>
<p>It took Ali <span class="gD">Riza Gürbüz over 30 years to feel welcome in Germany. Originally from East Anatolia, Ali moved to Berlin at age 12 with his brother and sister. His mother had arrived 8 years prior in 1973 as part of the last wave of guest worker recruitment. She was living in <span class="st">Neukölln and working for a cleaning company</span>. His father stayed behind in Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="gD"><em>The beginning wasn&#8217;t easy</em>, Ali recounts. Understanding German society, learning the language, feeling at home&#8230; this all took time. But eventually he gained his footing, finished his schooling, completed an <em>Ausbildung</em> (apprenticeship), and in 1986, began a career in industrial mechanics. Today, he&#8217;s married, has a 12 year old daughter and an active social life, and makes music in his free time. He still lives in N<span class="st">eukölln. </span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="gD"><strong>But despite spending the majority of his life in Germany, having German citizenship, and making a home here, he&#8217;s often felt like an outsider.</strong> </span></p>
<p><em>I still don&#8217;t really have any German friends</em>, Ali tells me on the last night of Ramadan in July, after breaking the fast together. We&#8217;re sitting outside on Kreuzberg&#8217;s iconic <span class="st"><em>Oranienstraße</em></span> with his friends, also both named Ali, both German-Turks* born in Berlin. Ali and Ali nod their heads in agreement. A rollerblading demonstration passes by in front of us. <em>I don&#8217;t understand it,</em> Ali says. <em>We all have the same sources of stress &#8211; work, money, family &#8211; so why don&#8217;t we make more of an effort to be nice to one another? </em></p>
<div id="attachment_3358" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3358" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3358 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xbergalis-650x473.jpg" alt="Breaking the fast on Oranienstraße" width="650" height="473" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xbergalis-650x473.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xbergalis-300x218.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xbergalis.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3358" class="wp-caption-text">Breaking the fast on Oranienstraße</p></div>
<p><span class="gD">Ali can cite the definitive moment in which he felt that he had finally &#8220;arrived&#8221; in Germany. <em>I was in the Bundeswehrkrankenhaus [German Armed Forces hospital] last December for a week due to a skin issue. I received such kind and affectionate treatment from the nurses and doctors. The same treatment as everyone else. I shared a room with a guy named Wolfgang, and we talked for two days straight, about everything. The atmosphere made me feel really welcome and inspired.</em></span></p>
<p>So inspired, that he started writing a song on his phone while still on his hospital bed. Two days after he was released, he finished &#8220;Ali <span class="st">für</span> Deutschland&#8221; (literally &#8220;Ali for Germany&#8221;), a World Cup song in <span class="gD">support of the </span>German national team. After recording it, Ali ran around to different departments and bureaus in the city, asking for support. Eventually he got a production company to film it for free. The song is available for purchase online (99 cents on iTunes) and half of the proceeds go to a homeless shelter in his neighborhood.<em> I really believed in the song and project, </em>Ali explains, <em>I wanted to show that someone who has my name and looks like me supports the German team. That people from all over the world with different backgrounds live here and consider it their home. </em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Ali <span class="st">für</span> Deutschland Music Video: </strong></p>
<p><iframe width="650" height="366" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mzqz6hCF7uI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Singing alongside Ali in the music video is his daughter. <em>I see that she&#8217;s growing up differently than I did, that she&#8217;s happier. I hope this song contributes to that. </em>For Ali, it all comes back to the media. <em>When Mesut Özil [German-Turkish football player] makes a good play, German-Turkish kids get patted on the back. If he does poorly, people shake their heads at us. The migration background is always emphasized. </em></p>
<p>Ali&#8217;s point is backed by research. <a href="http://www.stern.de/panorama/stern-umfrage-knappe-mehrheit-lehnt-islam-als-teil-deutschlands-ab-2128967.html">A recent Stern poll</a> shows that over half of Germans believe that Islam does not belong in German society. <a href="http://mediendienst-integration.de/artikel/der-islam-gehoert-zu-deutschland-spielhaus.html">Experts</a> argue that Islam is often conflated with Turks, the headscarf, and migration due to images perpetuated in the media. Another common image: German-Turkish or Arab youth as more violent or prone to criminal acts than their &#8220;native&#8221; counterparts, a stereotype repeatedly rebuked by <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/schulspiegel/wissen/kriminalitaet-von-migranten-laut-gutachten-nicht-hoeher-a-983536.html">studies</a>. <em>There are so many positive examples of what German-Turks have done and do for this country</em>, Ali says,<em> but news and social media continuously choose to show negative images. I want the media to show more positive images. </em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Ali is a positive person by nature. His face lights up when he shares stories of making connections to people at work or through his music. But he also has plenty of examples of feeling unwelcome or misunderstood on account of his background. He makes a conscious effort to speak Turkish with his daughter only at home and German out in public, in order to avoid judgment. More than once he&#8217;s been told &#8220;Du bist mein Lieblingst<span class="st">ürke</span><em>&#8221; </em>(&#8220;You&#8217;re my favorite Turk&#8221;), by a coworker or a club bouncer, for not stirring up trouble. <em>What am I supposed to do with that?</em> Ali asks, his eyes filling with emotion. Recently, a colleague joked to Ali that the reason his work contract was not renewed was because of his new hairstyle. <em>You look like a Turk now</em>, he told Ali.</p>
<p>After 6 years at the company, successfully training incoming employees, Ali had expected to keep his job. <em>After the video, they told me my music was making me slower at work, which wasn&#8217;t true,</em> Ali says, shaking his head<em>. <strong>I always felt like they were waiting for me to explode, to show my &#8220;Turkish temper&#8221;. In the end I think they just couldn&#8217;t deal with my humanness.</strong></em></p>
<div id="attachment_3359" style="width: 579px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3359" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3359" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/alitsm.jpg" alt="Performing at a Football Academy Gala, August 2014" width="569" height="335" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/alitsm.jpg 569w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/alitsm-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3359" class="wp-caption-text">Performing at a Football Academy Gala, August 2014</p></div>
<p>Ali is disappointed but not disheartened. He is taking this unexpected turn as a chance to reconsider career paths. <em>I have so much experience, and I want to use that to do something good</em>, he says. He&#8217;s now thinking seriously about becoming a social worker for kids with migration backgrounds. <em>I know </em><em>what they&#8217;re going through.</em> <em>I can go into their homes and talk to their parents, help them see what options they have and make sure they don&#8217;t give up. </em>More than likely, he&#8217;ll do it with music. <em>I learned early on that music allows you to reach a lot of people. Music is its own language, one that you don&#8217;t need to understand, just feel.</em></p>
<p>Ali is certainly &#8220;for&#8221; Germany, but does he consider himself from Germany? <em>Whew,</em> Ali lets out a deep breath, <em>I&#8217;m not sure. I have parts of German culture and parts of Turkish culture. But I think, most of all, I&#8217;m a Berliner.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2006 Germany hosted the World Cup; it also organized a social-marketing campaign for the sole purpose of revamping and re-solidifying patriotism. These things, i.e. national pride, rarely happen organically, particularly for countries with strong regional identities and histories of division. The goal of the campaign: the encouragement of colors-wearing, flag-toting, &#8216;Schland&#8217;-cheering citizens of the federal republic. One image made its way through German newspapers and magazines during this novel World Cup fever, representing what was now allowed, what could again be said without glancing over one&#8217;s shoulder &#8211; a 15-year old girl, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/index-2014-29.html">Monique Bienge</a>, waving a scarf on which the German national anthem is printed, as pictured below.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-47282143.html"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2874 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/die-deutschland-party.jpg" alt="Germany World Cup" width="454" height="599" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/die-deutschland-party.jpg 454w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/die-deutschland-party-227x300.jpg 227w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></a></p>
<p>The text on Monique&#8217;s scarf reads:</p>
<p><em>Unity and justice and freedom</em><br />
<em> for the German fatherland!</em><br />
<em> To that let us aspire</em><br />
<em> In a spirit of fraternity,</em><br />
<em> With heart and soul.</em></p>
<p>So-called football nationalism is not limited to one time of the year (or to every four years, for that matter), however. Its colors bleed into the surrounding shapes of civic life, exerting influence and changing norms with each successive step toward normalcy. The iconic image pictured above articulates Germany&#8217;s re-entrance through the gates of national pride &#8211; a process that began <em>en force </em>in 2006 and culminates today with the German national team&#8217;s WC victory.</p>
<p>But back when the gates were still swinging closed, often in classrooms or at the dinner table of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/68er-Bewegung">68er</a> grandparents, German politicians didn&#8217;t dare proclaim the type of national pride other countries are famous for. The American political landscape I know<em> requires</em> a language of exceptionalism*, as even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK7JEYqIfw4">President Obama&#8217;s recent speech at the UN General Assembly</a> demonstrates. In stark contrast, a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/muegelner-buergermeister-ich-bin-stolz-deutscher-zu-sein-a-502950.html">mayor in Saxony in 2007</a> said he was &#8216;proud to be German&#8217;, and public rebukes followed (in part due to accusations of radical-right leanings); the jury was still in session.</p>
<p><strong>This year things were a bit different.</strong></p>
<p>After the German national team took home the trophy, standing before Berlin&#8217;s Brandenburg Gate with faces toward the historic German <em>Siegessäule</em> or &#8216;pillar of victory&#8217;,<em> </em>German flags did not disappear, did not crawl back into the hole from whence they had come. Little old ladies with bags of flowers and desserts kept their colored armbands tightly on the wrist; pubescent school kids kept wearing jerseys to school, in many cases looking a little underwashed and a little over-hormoned.</p>
<p>And it all seemed so normal, at least for some of us. And yet, as <a href="http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2014-07/schweinsteiger-blutkrieger-dfb-medienkritik">an article in <em>die Zeit</em></a> (a German weekly) pointed out, this was again anything but an organic process: &#8220;The German Football Association managed to become a synonym for Germany&#8221;, explained in part by what the author called &#8217;embedded journalism&#8217; of a different type, AKA German media sources working closely to manufacture a patriotic relationship to the German soccer team &#8211; something the association (DFB) does not vehemently deny.</p>
<p>But even if many citizens and residents of Germany were convinced of the linkage between national pride and a football win, latent critique still found its way into the conversation, particularly in response to the team&#8217;s <a href="http://youtu.be/bg6ZFv63URE">controversial parody</a> of the defeated Argentinians.</p>
<p><em>Die taz</em> (a German daily) <a href="http://taz.de/Pro-und-Contra-Gauchogate/!142556/">debated the potential controversy</a>; even a <a href="http://taz.de/Nachlese-zur-Fussball-WM/!142947/">guest post </a>from someone associated with the team asked, <em>if we are allowed to celebrate, how loud, how long, and who is included?</em> <em>Der Spiegel</em> (a tad more conservative national magazine) went after a similar though more general question &#8211; <em>who are we Germans again</em>? With a fully-veiled woman, a <em>Pfand</em>-schlepping chap, a working mother, all cloaked in German colors, the magazine responded: &#8216;We Germans&#8217;<em>, </em>as<em> </em>the cover photo and its video are called, are all a little different.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/images/image-723794-magazincover300-dmug.gif" rel="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/index-2014-29.html"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://www.spiegel.de/images/image-723794-magazincover300-dmug.gif" alt="Der Spiegel World Cup" width="300" height="396" /></a></p>
<p>In other countries, patriotic displays would likely not be paired with an existential crisis. But this is Germany. As the above extract from the German national anthem mentions, a fatherland is at stake here &#8211; one that, at the time of the anthem&#8217;s composition, did not exist.</p>
<p>German-speaking public officials and intellectuals debated the question of identity and belonging during the years leading up to the creation of the federal conglomeration of German states (out of the former Holy Roman Empire and environs). And in 1871, (mostly) peasants were absorbed into a territorial construction more or less controlled by Prussia (a state no longer in existence), all based on inklings of a so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Germanism">Pan-Germanism</a>. In other words, <em>whose </em>&#8216;fatherland&#8217; we are really talking about depends not only on who you ask, but also on when this question is and has been posed in the past.</p>
<p><strong>But what might this mean for the public exercise of patriotism?</strong></p>
<p>The historically-rooted &#8216;German question&#8217; &#8211; i.e. who are the Germans? &#8211; has yet to be completely solved. This is the point. How could it be? Countries, their populations, their mandates, their political philosophies of law and justice, even their borders, are constantly changing.</p>
<p><strong>As <em>Der Spiegel&#8217;s</em> &#8220;We Germans&#8221; cover demonstrates, the WC victory might be an opportunity to collectively re-work this changing German identity, while it is still hot and malleable.</strong></p>
<p>For the outsider, all this hullabaloo in the face of three differently colored stripes might seem exaggerated, even just written off as a sign of unresolved historical traumata. But from a philosophical perspective, it is indeed productive to acknowledge all that patriotism implies, i.e. what and whom it excludes. Such a topic is ever-relevant to the productive identity project that might emerge from this World Cup victory&#8230; with the potential to re-create boundaries of belonging for the better.</p>
<p>The cacophony of voices relating to Germanness and all that it encompasses has often been frustrating for German politicians, particularly in relation to defining citizenship laws. But rallies in the streets and public displays of &#8216;belonging to the German club&#8217; have somehow put these oft-exclusionary discussions on hold for a minute, giving journalists the chance to <a href="http://taz.de/WM-und-Integration-in-Berlin/!142407/">write about on-the-ground cohesion </a>or harmony in a country that often fosters a language of <a href="http://www.spiegel.tv/#/filme/duisburg-marxloh/">ghettoization</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2888" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://collidoscopeberlin.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/wm-berlin.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2888" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2888" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wm-berlin.jpg?w=640" alt="Photo by Juri Gottschau" width="640" height="401" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2888" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by <a href="http://www.jurigottschau.com/">Juri Gottschau</a></p></div>
<p>That said, after the streets have cleared and the flags have been taken down, <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/deutschland-ist-weltmeister-wm-traum-wm-trauma/10207938.html"><em>where does this leave the many immigrants or non-traditional members of German society</em>?</a> asked a columnist with immigration background, recently. For patriotism, like nationalism, thrives on exclusion. That is to say, a group is only a group if it has the capacity to actively determine who belongs and who does not. In essence, this is the definition of the modern state. Part of the state&#8217;s mandate is the ability to exercise force (as opposed to violence, according to Hannah Arendt), in order to maintain these boundaries, something rarely questioned in public discourse or by political constituencies.</p>
<p>These boundaries are not a given, however: they result from and are constantly reproduced in political processes,  enshrined not only in law but in everyday institutions, ideologies, and practices of the outsiders vs. the insiders. This means that they can be changed.</p>
<p><strong>In the end, this new German patriotism is only as good as the boundaries it is ready and able to redefine. An act of flowing colors and neighbor-to-neighbor high-fives may have started a new understanding of who is allowed into the club, but policies and institutions need to take it one step further. Otherwise, patriotism is just as good as nationalism &#8211; a political project and instrument of the state with the purpose of coercing national conscription, labor-market participation, and civic legitimacy by way of <em>exceptionalism</em>.</strong></p>
<p>In the type of inclusive global society many of us would love to build, there is no room for exceptionalism.</p>
<p>All big words and ideas aside, patriotism might have the chance to be democratic and inclusive or it might become dangerously exclusive. As I have witnessed in my home country of the United States, this often depends on who sets the governmental agenda but also who shapes discussions as to what types of restrictions are legitimate, particularly in regards to labor-market and immigration policies.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be so top-down or even so economically-driven. We can decide who belongs to our club, and maybe, in an ideal world, politicians will respond. In my opinion, this should be the German World Cup take-away.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p>*The phenomenon of national exceptionalism as a political value and even as a &#8216;moral quest&#8217; is demonstrated best by the American political right and the movement to shame political leaders or public opposition who <em>do not</em> believe in the superior story, governmental system, and social values of the United States. Newt Gingrich&#8217;s propaganda-documentary <a href="http://youtu.be/oQsCW1hbOGw">A City Upon a Hill</a> is case-in-point; Ron Paul&#8217;s (of the far-right American Libertarian Party) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BOrM6j1-2s">defense of his own views of &#8216;moderate exceptionalism&#8217;</a> to conservative critiques is another.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 2, the new <a href="http://www.bim.hu-berlin.de/">Berlin Institute for Empirical Research on Integration and Migration</a> (BIM) was launched. Certainly not the first institute of its kind in Germany, Berlin&#8217;s Humboldt University, the Hertie Foundation, the Federal Employment Agency, and the German Football Association held a <a href="http://www.hu-berlin.de/service/veranstaltungen/veranstaltungen_neu/?stat=show&amp;vk_id=2715">press conference</a> to frame this initiative as new and needed. The reason: the field  &#8211; what is really known about the integration or inclusion of diversity &#8211; is more desert than rain-forest in this country of immigration.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bim-7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2419" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bim-7.jpg?w=550" alt="BIM 7" width="550" height="668" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bim-7.jpg 535w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bim-7-247x300.jpg 247w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>Improving the civic and social infrastructure of a city often begins with data. Aside from &#8220;Big Data&#8221; being the buzzword of 2014, plain ol&#8217; data is worth discussing. For <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/huge-new-york-development-project-becomes-a-data-science-lab/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">data can instruct city planners, lawmakers, social workers etc. to better approach problems of urban spaces</a> and their economies, in ways which benefit residents, including the marginalized. It might just be common sense, but empirical research (the critical boots-on-the-ground kind) is an act of taking stock of what is and what isn&#8217;t, which can prove quite useful in societies undergoing (or just learning to deal with) change.</p>
<p>Data, in this sense, is information gathered to solve a problem or answer a question. According to all panelists at the press conference, whether researchers or community and/or political stakeholders, this data is desperately required to answer the question of integration. Or is integration instead a problem to be solved?</p>
<p>As one of the not-so-timid anthropologists on the stage stated during the round of questions, <em>What we are really taking about, when we talk about integration, is how to learn to deal with and approach difference in society. </em></p>
<p><strong>The data imperative</strong></p>
<p>In light of Germany&#8217;s changing demography and political landscape, regarding immigration policy, the categories and models used to understand and support local populations have become outdated, as the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-coalition-talks-move-closer-to-new-dual-citizenship-law-a-933523.html">dual-citizenship debate</a> in German Parliament over the last few months has indicated. More than just the classic census is required to capture the complexity of today&#8217;s metropolis. In Germany&#8217;s capital, where policy-makers brush shoulders with constituents and neighbors alike, real data could not be more in demand and yet, ironically, easier to find. This data goes beyond numbers.</p>
<p>Given this deficit of information and the few reasons for it, the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2014/04/2014-04-02-integration-kuratoriumsvorsitz.html">has been actively involved in BMI&#8217;s founding</a> and is set to be involved in its future;  BAMF&#8217;s new federal integration commissioner, Aydan Özo<span style="color: #435050;">ğ</span>uz<span style="color: #435050;">,</span> is a key member of the BIM board. Her vocal presence at the press conference made one thing clear: <em>We don&#8217;t even have the numbers, quite honestly, to determine these differences</em> [between &#8216;foreigners&#8217;, &#8216;foreign-born&#8217;, citizens with migration background etc.]. <em>This makes my job quite difficult</em>, she articulated loudly to the audience of mostly journalists. <em>We just do not have the data.</em></p>
<div style="width: 659px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Artikel/IB/Bilder-IB/2014-04-02-eroeffnung-bim2.jpg?__blob=bpaTopmeldung&amp;v=1" alt="Eröffnungsveranstaltung des Berliner Instituts für empirische Integrations- und Migrationsforschung" width="649" height="406" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo source: BIM HU, Dirk Enters</p></div>
<p>Wolfgang Niersbach, President of the German Football Association (DFB) &#8211; one of three sponsors of the institute and the DFB&#8217;s first sponsorship of this kind &#8211; reiterated this data-driven impetus for more research at length. In 2006, the DFB employed its very own integration commissioner to better navigate the challenging combination of passionate football fans, visible diversity, and racism. A sweeping anti-racism campaign has been the culmination of these efforts, <em>though much is still to be learned</em>, Niersbach said. <em>Our hope for this institute is to get some more solid ground under our feet, to learn more about what works and what doesn&#8217;t work. </em>It is a learning process, and it begins with better information.</p>
<p>A key research focus of the new institute is the relationship between sports and integration, e.g., the participation of youth with migration backgrounds in local football clubs. But the playing field is different in football; <em>integration happens everyday, as 40% of the players have non-German backgrounds,</em> Niersbach mentioned emphatically, looking down the table at colleagues to see their reactions. To boot, social or ethnic differences are experienced on a more intensive and yet common-place level (at least organizationally) in football, compared to German society at large.</p>
<p>Niersbach explained: <em>Two talented football players grow up in Nuremberg playing together, they both go professional, they both have Turkish backgrounds. One day, one of them calls us up and says that he has decided to play for the Turkish national team, the other for the German national team. We are completely fine with that! We let them do what they want to do! But it was not always like that. </em>Times have changed, and so should terms and categories (the dual-citizenship debate, once again case-in-point).</p>
<p><strong>A clarification of terms</strong></p>
<p>The institute&#8217;s projects, team of researchers, sponsors, as well as its leadership, are truly diverse. Inter-disciplinary and embracing of different methodologies and languages of information, the institute seeks to embody what it studies, something Dr. Sebastian Braun, Director of BIM, emphasized throughout his introduction. A football advocate seated next to a well-known political scientist and culture critic;  anthropologists gawking at the government employee over-using the word &#8216;foreigner&#8217;; clinical psychiatrists tolerating the tactics of the employment agency, in dealing with issues of health and job competency. Diversity has to begin somewhere.</p>
<p>But where it will certainly prove to get messy is in this sticky, touchy realm of language.</p>
<p>Frank J. Weiser of the Federal Employment Agency spoke from the perspective of the market-driven state, the key aim of which is full employment and a balanced checkbook: <em>We want to improve our work with </em>Ausländer (foreigners)&#8230;<em>many of these foreigners have access to entitlement programs and experience higher unemployment than their German counterparts. I just work with the numbers, </em>he said smiling, seeming pleased with his honesty. <em>Social cohesion, approaching difference &#8211; but what about jobs?!</em>, he might have said.</p>
<p>The fissure between practice, policy, and the ideals of academia is still there and not likely to go away.</p>
<div id="attachment_3410" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3410" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3410 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bim-3.jpg" alt="Director of German Football Association, Rep.

Director of Federal Employment Agency; Photo source: DFB</p></div>
<p><em>The foreigners on our football teams used to be the exotics. In 1963, when DFB was founded, we only had three players with any sort of migration background. Today, 40% of our players have some relationship to immigration, </em>Niersbach commented.</p>
<p>Hands shot up in a hurry from the rows of journalists filling the hall.</p>
<p>A free-lance reporter and coach for a local football league called the use of the word <em>&#8220;Ausländer&#8221;</em> (foreigner)<em> </em>by both men into question. How strange it was to hear a term describing kids born or raised in Germany, kids that play football in Germany as foreign: <em>There are kids that play on our teams that are different, yes, but they play together&#8230; these kids don&#8217;t need to be integrated just because they happen to have a different skin tone.</em></p>
<p>The most vocal of the anthropologists, Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Kaschuba, director of Humboldt University&#8217;s European-Anthropology Department, agreed with this critique, bringing the other oddly-applied term <em>Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund</em> (people with migration background) into the discussion. It is not just about the word &#8220;foreigner&#8221;, which connotes otherness, apart-ness; rather, the problem lies with the terms themselves, how they shift from one individual or community to the next without time for distinction &#8211; <em>that is the humorous aspect in all of it</em> and the aspect worth exploration, i.e. empirical research. <em>I don&#8217;t used the word Ausländer at all, but I do use </em>Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund<em>, though I shorten it to MMH, and I say it M-M-H just to emphasize the irony of these terms in the German debate.</em></p>
<p>To close this round of questions, the Director of Humboldt University added, <em>When we are talking about integration, we are focusing on those people who have decided to stay in Germany, to live here, to work here. </em>But what does it mean to &#8220;decide&#8221;? To stay? To live? No one at the front of the room mentioned citizenship laws, legal frameworks regarding work and residency permission, or those political ideologies that might bar any empirical work on terminology from having real impact in Parliament. Surely, data for this will be gathered, but the question is, who will listen.</p>
<p><strong>Taking stock</strong></p>
<p>In response to a question from the <em>Tagesspiegel, as to how this institute plans to transfer its knowledge to policy-makers</em>, Naika Forouton, the Representative Director of the institute, responded, <em>One of the purposes of the institute is to move away from a one-sided discourse that we have all experienced&#8230;[However], We do not see that as our job, delivering some report to policy-makers. Pure political performance is not our role.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bim-4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2411" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bim-4.jpg?w=640" alt="BIM 4" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>In 2013 Naika Forouton wrote a highly-informative report in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/">Migration Policy Institute</a> (MPI), based in Washington D.C., on <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/identity-and-muslim-integration-germany">Muslim identity and citizenship in Germany</a>. In 2012, she contributed to a volume of policy analyses for MPI. Policy analysis and the effects thereof constitute a large part of her professional activities, in fact. Perhaps the difference lies in the medium.</p>
<p>In closing, federal integration commissioner, Aydan Özo<span style="color: #435050;">ğ</span>uz, described the field to be investigated by the new BIM as deserted, barren. And to that, <em>Immigrants have been here a long time, but now they are simply increasing. The current discourse is dominated by fear; it is a fear-laden process. It is important, with this in mind, to represent how things really are.</em></p>
<p>But can we amend this desolate landscape through empirical research alone and the data it yields?</p>
<p>The anthropologist, Dr. Wolfgang Kaschuba, seemed to say &#8220;no&#8221;: <em>We need a new form of group understanding, group consensus, even relationships, even in the postmodern age, even in the era of individualism. We need to come together.</em></p>
<p>If all this coming together will produce the data this city and its neighborhoods need, somehow making it to the highest echelons of power, the BIM is a needed initiative, indeed. If not, the ivory-tower-dilemma may leave the German Football Association and others in waiting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Had I hopped into Orhan&#8217;s taxi en route to the airport, I likely would&#8217;ve assumed he was Turkish and left it at that. He might have asked me where I was flying to and I might have commented on the weather. He would&#8217;ve pulled my suitcase out of the trunk and wished me a good flight, and I would&#8217;ve thanked him. But instead, thankfully, I met Orhan in a very different context &#8211; our half-marathon training group. What follows here is his story about growing up in Kurdistan and Turkey as the child of guest workers and moving to Berlin 20 years ago. The story I would&#8217;ve likely missed. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_2377" style="width: 588px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-30-09-50-36-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2377" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2377" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-30-09-50-36-1.jpg?w=640" alt="Orhan and Sophia pre 2014 Berlin half marathon" width="578" height="578" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-30-09-50-36-1.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-30-09-50-36-1-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2377" class="wp-caption-text">Orhan and I pre-race 2014</p></div>
<p>I meet Orhan at Fehrbelliner Platz&#8217;s Park <span class="st">Café</span>. We choose a table outside amongst the masses soaking up the unusually warm March sun. It&#8217;s that strange break between afternoon and evening,  the mood equally fitting for a coffee or beer. The space is buzzing but in a state of exhalation, as the day starts to settle and everyone&#8217;s shoulders wilt a few centimeters. This is where Orhan spends every Thursday between 4:45 and 6pm, while his daughter takes a kickboxing class around the corner.</p>
<p>My first order of business is a selfish one: though I&#8217;ve asked Orhan multiple times to tell me where he grew up, I still can&#8217;t remember the name, let alone comprehend its location geographically. Orhan draws me a little diagram: he grew up in <em>Hotan</em>, a tiny village near a town called <em>Varto</em>, part of a district called <span class="st"><em>Mûş</em></span> that lies in Anatolia, in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of Turkey.</p>
<div id="2330" style="width: 582px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://geopoliticsrst.blogspot.de/2012/10/turkei.html"><img aria-describedby="caption-2330" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2330 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mapkurdistan.jpg" alt="Kurdistan on a map " width="572" height="447" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mapkurdistan.jpg 572w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mapkurdistan-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></a><p id="caption-2330" class="wp-caption-text">Varto is slightly northeast of Diyarbakir, the unofficial capital of Turkish Kurdistan</p></div>
<p>Orhan was 5 when his father moved to Berlin in 1972. It was only one year before West Germany would halt guest worker recruitment from non-European countries to fill labor shortages after World War II. His mother followed 7 years later with his youngest sister and they lived in Rudow in southeastern Neukölln &#8211; where they still live over 30 years later. <em>They got jobs as cleaners in an office</em>, Orhan recounts, <em>but they were fired!</em> he adds, snorting in laughter.  I look up from my notepad, surprised. &#8220;Why is that funny?&#8221; <em>Well, they worked with friends &#8211; they&#8217;d moved to Berlin together &#8211; and one of the guys was really funny. So they were always fooling around and making noise..</em>.<em> and one day they got fired! That guy was a real comedian.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Orhan only heard that story years later. He had stayed behind in Kurdistan, in the village with his grandmother. <em>My father didn&#8217;t plan on staying that long, like most guest workers</em>, Orhan explains,<em> but my mom eventually went, too, and my Oma became my main mom. She ended up raising me. </em>After school, Orhan did an apprenticeship in wood-making<em>. It was a 6km walk to work from Oma&#8217;s every day, alone, sometimes in 1m of snow. I was always scared the wolves would get me! </em></p>
<div id="attachment_2368" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gallery_0610222020109423828131.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2368" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2368" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gallery_0610222020109423828131.jpg?w=640" alt="Portrait of a Kurdish woman (Source: Renkliisler)" width="640" height="648" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2368" class="wp-caption-text">Portrait of a Kurdish woman in Varto (Source: Renkliisler)</p></div>
<p>In the 1980s, Orhan&#8217;s parents used money earned in Germany to buy land and build a house in Izmir, on Turkey&#8217;s western coast. Orhan switched from wood-making to electrician work, and got a factory job making stoves. His remaining siblings (of which there are 5 total) started to join his parents in Berlin, applying for visas and leaving one by one. Orhan applied too, but his request was denied. German family reunification policy* has a 16 year old age limit for third country (non EU) nationals to join their parents in Germany. After age 15, other factors apply for a residence permit, such as German language proficiency and the &#8220;ability to integrate&#8221;. Orhan was already in his 20s. So he stayed in Izmir, looking after the house and spending summers in the village with his grandmother and uncle. Then came 1993, when <em>Hotan </em>and many other Kurdish villages were destroyed in a war between Turkish government forces and Kurdish rebels. The war, called &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/24/world/kurds-are-finally-heard-turkey-burned-our-villages.html">one of the most violent secrets of the 1990&#8217;s</a>&#8220;, killed more than 30,000 and displaced thousands more.</p>
<p>Orhan&#8217;s chance to go to Germany came shortly thereafter. <em>My boss asked me to go to Germany to fix a faulty order we had exported there&#8230; they needed someone who spoke a little German. </em>It was Orhan&#8217;s first trip to Germany, and by the time he returned, he had decided to try moving there again. <em>Since I had gotten a visa for the work trip and come back, I had earned the Embassy&#8217;s trust</em>, Orhan chuckles, <em>it was much easier to apply for a visa the next time.</em> On December 10, 1994, Orhan left Turkey with a 3 month visa. Upon arrival in Germany he applied for asylum. He was 27.</p>
<p>He was sent to an asylum home outside Berlin in <span class="st">Eisenhüttenstadt, Brandenburg</span>. <em>We were fed three times a day and the workers were pretty nice to us, but the conditions weren&#8217;t great&#8230; 7 or 8 of us sleeping together in one room. </em>For a year, Orhan spent one night every two weeks there to comply with policy.<em> They knew my family was in Berlin&#8230; I spent the rest of the time with them. </em>Orhan&#8217;s asylum request was eventually granted, on the grounds that his hometown in Kurdistan had been destroyed. <em><br />
</em></p>
<div id="2341" style="width: 618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article123743604/Asylbewerberheim-in-Eisenhuettenstadt.html"><img aria-describedby="caption-2341" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2341 " src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/asylbewerberheim-in-eisenhuettenstadt.jpg" alt="asylum home in Eisenhuettenstadt" width="608" height="405" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/asylbewerberheim-in-eisenhuettenstadt.jpg 620w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/asylbewerberheim-in-eisenhuettenstadt-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></a><p id="caption-2341" class="wp-caption-text">Asylum seekers arrive to Eisenhüttenstadt (Source: Die Welt)</p></div>
<p>This was in the mid-1990s, a decade before Germany would officially recognize itself as a country of immigration and develop a <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/18/review-become-a-german/">national integration plan that included integration courses for newcomers</a>. Orhan signed up for a language course on his own, hoping to learn enough German to study economics at university. He quit after 3 months. <em>It wasn&#8217;t fun and always after work</em><em>, when I was so tired </em>(he did construction at the time)<em>. </em><em>The grammar was really hard. It&#8217;s still hard.<br />
</em></p>
<p>A cousin&#8217;s <span class="st">fiancé</span> suggested he try being a taxi driver. <em>I failed my taxi license test 3 times because I couldn&#8217;t pronounce the street names correctly!</em> <em>Being a taxi driver is a bit boring but it&#8217;s a clean job. Not like construction. And I like the freedom.</em></p>
<p>Orhan&#8217;s been a taxi driver ever since, working 10 hour days 5-6 days a week. He has two children, a son from his first marriage to a Turkish-German woman and a daughter with his current wife, whom he met at a gym over 10 years ago &#8211; a gym they still attend together. <em>I live a good life here. I travel a lot and I have a flexible job. </em>Orhan tries to go to Kurdistan at least once or twice a year, and has taken his kids 4 times. His next visit is this May. <em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>My kids have 59% <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/">Migrationshintergrund</a>, </em>Orhan says laughing,<em> when I&#8217;m angry with my son I scold him in Turkish, but usually we speak German. He can understand Kurdish, too.</em> <em>I tried speaking Kurdish with my daughter for a year but then gave up,</em> he adds, a hint of regret in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think German integration policy has gotten better since you first arrived here 20 years ago? With services like the integration courses?&#8221; <em>German immigration policy isn&#8217;t very fair</em>, Orhan replies scowling, <em>If I marry someone from Turkey and want to bring them here, they have to prove they speak German before arriving! But people from <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/11/20/roma-in-berlin-bureaucracy-in-lichtenberg/">Bulgaria and Romania</a>** can just come here and get social benefits even if they don&#8217;t speak the language</em>.</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t have German citizenship and I don&#8217;t want it,</em> Orhan declares, <em>why would I need it? </em><em>My wife and I want to buy a house in Izmir and spend maybe one third of the year there. Four months in Berlin, 4 in Izmir, 4 in Kurdistan. There&#8217;s nothing special there, where I&#8217;m from in Kurdistan&#8230; only mountains, animals </em>(the wolves!)<em>, and rocks, but, </em>Orhan makes a fist and holds it close to his stomach, <em>it still feels like home.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varto">According to Wikipedia</a>, Berlin holds Europe&#8217;s largest population from Varto, Kurdistan. Germany has Europe&#8217;s largest population of Kurds, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2013/05/201358161349732897.html">approximately 800,000</a>, many of whom came as guest workers in the 1960s.

<p>**Despite being part of the EU since 2007, Bulgarians and Romanians have only had access to Germany&#8217;s social welfare system since 2014, when Germany lifted work policy restrictions. This was after the EU deemed Germany in violation of economic rules of engagement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Immigrant integration and identity can be very personal subjects and not everyone wishes for their views and experiences to be made public. Though all the stories in this interview are true, names and some cities have been changed to protect the artist&#8217;s identity, per his request.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_0609.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_0609.jpg?w=640" alt="Admiralbruecke in Kreuzberg" width="604" height="604" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy (<a href="http://www.uberlin.co.uk/stereotypes-different-expats-youll-meet-berlin/">and admittedly amusing</a>) to reduce expats to stereotypes, as if we all neatly fall into one or the other category based on which country we hail from, what we do for a living, or where we party and eat brunch. Reality is always more nuanced and multi-dimensional. Dare we even say, interesting?</p>
<p>Take Alex, American-born artist and documentary filmmaker living in Berlin. On first sight, the dual American-Polish citizen may appear to fit into a few niches: creative type with a studio in <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2014/02/20/lens-an-ode-to-the-maybachufer/">trendy Kreuzberg</a>, one of a rapidly growing number of young <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/07/rant-or-rave-jew-in-a-box/">Jews in Berlin</a>, jetsetter popping between speaking engagements in Europe and gigs in Los Angeles and Seattle. But Alex&#8217;s life in Berlin was more happy accident than predestined by career or background. The idea came from a professor who happened to hear him &#8220;complaining in the hallway about wanting to leave [his homestate] Illinois” and suggested a semester program in Offenbach near Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alex left the U.S. for Germany, and in the past decade, has spent time in Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Karlsruhe. For the past six years he has been Berlin-based.</p>
<p><a href="http://friedrichshainblog.de/santa-maria-gutes-mexikanisches-restaurant-in-berlin-kreuzberg/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2225" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg.jpg" alt="santa maria in kreuzberg" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg.jpg 600w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/santa-maria-mexikaner-kreuzberg-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I meet Alex in his studio on Adalbertstraße, where he shows me some clips of his documentary films and tells me start-ups are starting to take-over former artist space in the building. &#8220;Do you feel integrated?&#8221; I ask later over habanero-spiked food and aguas frescas at Oranienstraße&#8217;s Santa Maria Restaurant. &#8220;You&#8217;re really making me think here,&#8221; Alex ponders, slicing into his pumpkin burrito, &#8220;it&#8217;s a top-heavy question though, isn&#8217;t it? Depends on what you mean by &#8216;integrated&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex isn&#8217;t a fan of dichotomies, the idea that every question always has a right or wrong answer. He prefers to see the world in three dimensions, which he describes as &#8220;the pause in-between inhaling and exhaling&#8221;. Fittingly, by the end of our conversation, he&#8217;s given us three dimensions through which to consider integration.</p>
<p><strong>The Dance Performance</strong></p>
<p>Alex recently attended a dance performance by Wang Ramirez, a pair that works between Berlin, Paris, and London and are &#8220;<a href="http://wangramirez.com/">as diverse as the cultures that clashed and harmonized when its founders met</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“She is ethnically Korean but grew up in Germany, and he grew up in France but has Spanish roots,” Alex explains. &#8220;At one part during the evening&#8217;s program, a woman comes on stage and asks them one of those typical questions about language and identity. How their backgrounds influence their performance and such. Wang and Ramirez respond in a mix of languages and movements, getting progressively more incoherent, to show how essentially absurd and futile that question can be.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/79000095"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-2223" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wangramirez.jpg" alt="wangramirez" width="601" height="335" /></a><br />
<strong>The Jewish Guilt</strong></p>
<p>While attending a conference in Weimar to hear a professor friend of his speak, Alex was approached by a young German student looking for participants in a Jewish identity project.&#8221;He had just found out that he had some Jewish ancestry,&#8221; Alex recounts. &#8220;He wanted to do a photography project on young Jews in Germany to acknowledge this, and asked us if we would participate. Later, when my friend and I were alone and could discuss openly, we realized this project, like so many others, was focused on the past. My friend said, &#8216;why doesn&#8217;t he focus on Germany&#8217;s future instead, as a multicultural country? Perhaps learning Turkish would be a more meaningful contribution.’&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Subway Encounter</strong></p>
<p>One late night on the U-Bahn, Alex found himself among a group of young Turkish-Germans. &#8220;People can&#8217;t usually tell where I&#8217;m from right off the bat. These guys in the U-Bahn asked me. My grandfather was a Sephardic Jew from Beirut, so I just told them I had a Lebanese grandfather and left out the rest. Once they thought I was Arab they started on how they love everyone and all religions&#8230; <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">Muslims</a>, Christians, Jews, etc. Later I wondered how the conversation would have been different if I had said I was Jewish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Berlin is a great place to come and figure out who you are and what you want to do. It&#8217;s just not the best place to make that happen, funding and opportunity wise,&#8221; Alex explains. &#8220;I always say Berlin is a city full of possibility, but not necessarily potential.&#8221; Alex, like many expats, is not sure what the future holds, other than it being a transnational one. No matter how much opportunity exists on the West Coast, it seems he will always be tied to Germany and, more specifically, Berlin. &#8220;Berlin is a city that breaks my heart,&#8221; he reminisces, &#8220;it broke my heart even before I lived here. Just the thought that a place like this even exists.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Berlin&#8217;s &#8220;problem district&#8221; to <a href="http://www.bz-berlin.de/aktuell/berlin/kreuzberg-teurer-als-charlottenburg-article1398469.html">more expensive</a> than <em>spießig</em> Charlottenburg: Kreuzberg&#8217;s made quite the transformation over the decades, but migration continues to shape its identity and reputation as a district.</p>
<p>The bulk of Kreuzberg&#8217;s diversity stems from the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s, when guest workers were recruited by West Germany to fill labor shortages after World War II*. Kreuzberg&#8217;s dilapidated housing became home to guest workers, primarily from Turkey. The district soon came to be known as &#8220;Little Istanbul&#8221;. In 2014 you would still be hard pressed to find a block without a <em>Döner</em> <em>Kebab </em>stand or five, but the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">district&#8217;s diversity</a> extends far past Anatolia.</p>
<p>Along with districts like Neukölln and Wedding, Kreuzberg is renowned for its <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/11/happy-weekend-its-not-about-integration-or-isnt-it/">immigrant integration</a> challenges that include low educational attainment and poor German language skills, high unemployment rates, crime and drug abuse, and gentrification. At the same time, the area has become increasingly attractive to <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/06/multiculturalism-diversity-and-the-big-city/">students</a>, hip expats, and young families. The result is a veritable array of nationalities, cuisines, houses of worship, and attires, as vivid as the graffiti gracing the walls of its gray housing and slender canals.</p>
<p>There are many popular spots in Kreuzberg, but the Maybachufer canal is perhaps one that most poignantly displays the cultural fusion that makes Kreuzberg a very special place to call home.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swans.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swans.jpg" alt="swans" width="594" height="594" /></a></p>
<p><strong>An Ode to the Maybachufer</strong></p>
<p>If I go away, I&#8217;ll remember the swans. And the walls of graffiti they floated along.</p>
<p>Rows of satellite dishes, speckled across gray concrete. Lingerers outside Kaiser&#8217;s, empty bottles at their feet.</p>
<p>Men huddled over pear-shaped glasses of Çay. Girls in tiny shorts and tights, snags in their thighs.</p>
<p>A market with only two rows, but infinite choice. Vendors calling &#8220;lecka! lecka!&#8221;, hints of somewhere else in their voice.</p>
<p>Hair smothered by scarves or impossibly fake dye. Individuals by words: &#8220;expat&#8221;, &#8220;immigrant&#8221;. You or I.</p>
<p>Where &#8220;German&#8221; ends and &#8220;other&#8221; begins, we futilely try to decide.</p>
<p>But the swans. They just keep floating by.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Sophia Burton</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The Maybachufer Turkish Market (U1-Kottbusser Tor or U8-Schoenleinstrasse) runs on Tuesdays and Fridays from approximately 12pm-6pm. Go for the cheap produce and spinach-cheese <em>Gözleme. </em><br />
</em></p>
<p>* West Germany recruited 14 million guest workers between 1955 and 1973 during the post World War II &#8220;economic miracle&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s November of last year and Kelly and I are visiting relatives of mine in Soest, a small town of under 50,000 in Northwestern Germany. We&#8217;re hanging out in the kitchen, chatting over a cup of coffee, when one of my cousin&#8217;s friends walks in. He pauses with one arm holding open the door, staring at us like a deer in headlights. Before we have the chance to say <em>Hallo</em> he&#8217;s turned and raced up the stairs to my cousin&#8217;s room. <em>Teenage boys</em>, we initially chuckled, thinking perhaps he had been surprised to find two random ladies in his friend&#8217;s kitchen. A couple hours later Kelly comes to the more probable conclusion: he was surprised to find two random <em>foreigners speaking English</em> in his friend&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p>Of course this kid had encountered English before, but most likely in the classroom, in books, on TV, and maybe even on a trip abroad. In the space of his friend&#8217;s home, we were completely out-of-context and foreign. It wasn&#8217;t the shock of his life, but it was a little more &#8220;difference&#8221; than he was used to.</p>
<div id="attachment_1824" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soest2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1824" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1824 " src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soest2.jpg?w=640" alt="soest2" width="640" height="640" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soest2.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soest2-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1824" class="wp-caption-text">The English Speaking Foreigners in Soest, November 2012</p></div>
<p>For those of us who live in diverse and international metropolises like Berlin, our &#8220;difference&#8221; thresholds tend to be higher.  We encounter &#8220;different&#8221; and &#8220;foreign&#8221; most days and in many forms: people, foods, music, smells, attire, houses of worship, celebrations, even neighborhoods. A few words in a foreign language doesn&#8217;t usually startle us, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t have difference thresholds of our own.</p>
<p>My &#8220;foreign language in the kitchen&#8221; equivalent was a hair salon in Charlottenburg.</p>
<p>For months I drove by Salon Hamid Nosrati on the bus or my bike en route to the office, straining my neck to observe a man prance around to blaring music as he chopped and trimmed, or sprawled out on a lounge chair outside the shop, praying to the sun gods (this is Burton family speak and means tanning, not actual praying), all while wearing bejeweled short shorts and crop tops. Hamid was eccentric, theatrical, and deliciously fun to watch. But his &#8220;difference&#8221; factor was a tick or two higher than I was used to &#8211; plus my hair was at stake &#8211; so I resigned myself to a spectator role and continued making appointments at my run-of-the-mill, cappuccino-serving, music-free salon instead.</p>
<p>It took about half a year, a few internal pep talks, and some online review reading before I finally summoned up the courage to make my first appointment. As soon as I walked in, Hamid greeted me with a broad smile, cheek kisses, and the familiar <em>du.</em> I was waved over to the ornate red couch to wait my turn and quickly gave up on the magazines to take in the sensory overload that would leave my head spinning and my foot tapping: Persian music blaring from the speakers, Brandy music videos from my middle school days playing on silent, gaudy statues of cherubs, seductive posters of Hamid, and of course the real deal right in front of me: adeptly shaving a teenage boy&#8217;s head while vigorously shaking his hips to the beat.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3415 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-08-09-16-13-091-650x650.jpg" alt="2013-08-09-16-13-09" width="650" height="650" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-08-09-16-13-091.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-08-09-16-13-091-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p><em>My passion is dance,</em> Hamid shares the obvious with me later while confidently snipping away at my bangs. <em>And hair styling of course, too,</em> he adds, chuckling, <em>dancing and hair styling,</em> <em>just like my mother. </em>He does a little spin and grabs the hairspray. I ask him if he grew up in Germany. He tells me his family immigrated to Berlin from Iran many years ago, he spent four years in Palma de Mallorca at some point, went to cosmetology school in Berlin, but doesn&#8217;t want to discuss exact dates. He also makes it very clear he won&#8217;t discuss politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you identify yourself? As Persian, German, both?&#8221; I ask, trying to focus on his story.</p>
<p><em>When people ask I say Iran is my home&#8230; I&#8217;m from there, I am Persian. But Berlin is my home, too.</em> <em>I love Germany, it&#8217;s a nice, rich country. And I love Berlin, it&#8217;s a pulsating, vibrant city&#8230; very </em>Multikulti<em>. I&#8217;ve seen it change a lot over the years&#8230; I was here before and after the Wall. I used to get a visa to go to the east on the weekends.  </em></p>
<p>&#8220;What does <em><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/07/10/whose-multikulti-is-it-the-elusive-definition-of-multiculturalism/">Multikulti</a></em> mean for you?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Different people from different countries and cultures, living together</em>, he replies simply, looking outside, swooping his arms, potentially demonstrating the space in which they do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does your salon tend to be <em>Multikulti</em>? In terms of your clients and employees?&#8221; I ask, thinking about his assistant who asked me if I was Turkish while he blow-dried my hair, then leaned in and giggled, adding <em>because Germans don&#8217;t have this much hair.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, many of my clients and employees have a </em><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/">Migrationshintergrund</a><em>, but everyone is welcome here</em>, Hamid emphasizes. His sister works part-time in the salon and his main assistant, Ali, is Turkish-Yugoslavian. Another Persian woman who didn&#8217;t speak any German was a newer employee.  <em>All the Persians in Berlin know me, </em>Hamid acknowledges.<em> But my clientele is very mixed. </em></p>
<div style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/hamidandkader.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/hamidandkader.jpg" alt="hamidandkader" width="389" height="583" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hamid with Kader Loth</p></div>
<p>Hamid brands himself as a &#8220;Star Friseur&#8221; (Star Hairstylist), in a sense bridging his dancing and hair styling passions. His clients range from kids from the neighborhood to Kader Loth, a famous Turkish-German photography model. Taped to his front window is a photo of him with Berlin&#8217;s mayor, Klaus Wowereit. Yet when asked what &#8220;Star Friseur&#8221; means to him, Hamid was more concentrated on the process than the person: <em>We&#8217;re all stars. It&#8217;s about wanting to feel like one more than actually being one. </em>Again he emphasizes: <em>Everyone is equal to us here</em>.</p>
<p>Hamid’s philosophy on integration is strikingly similar to his philosophy on hair: <em>Integration is personal, it comes from the individual and from inside. You have to make yourself welcome, not just expect others to do it for you.<br />
</em></p>
<p>&#8220;But how does one do that?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>You have to be yourself and be proud of who you are. I am who I am: I have my passions and live my life the way I want. I love everyone else even if they don’t love me back. </em>(I think of all the strange looks I&#8217;ve seen Hamid elicit from old ladies on the bus)<em>. Some people hate the Germans, but I just tell them the best way to overcome that is to just love them back anyway. They get confused by that,</em> he laughs.</p>
<p>By the end of our chat Hamid has taken my number and invited me to go dancing with him sometime. Keeping up with him won&#8217;t be easy, but it shouldn&#8217;t matter much. After all, we&#8217;re all stars to Hamid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.bild.de/geld/wirtschaft/zuwanderung/droht-uns-eine-roma-welle-29296194.bild.htmlhttp://www.bild.de/geld/wirtschaft/zuwanderung/droht-uns-eine-roma-welle-29296194.bild.html">Is a wave of Roma threatening Germany?</a>&#8221; was the recent headline of a popular paper, known for its tabloid-esque reporting. In the Eastern district of Lichtenberg, this headline becomes bureaucracy. In reality, it is about parents, children, and families, who happen to be Roma.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/roma-familie_dokumentationszentrum.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/roma-familie_dokumentationszentrum.jpg?w=640" alt="Roma Familie_Dokumentationszentrum" width="512" height="392" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sintiundroma.de/start.html">Source</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For my fieldwork in sociocultural anthropology, I run from one site of so-called immigrant integration to the next in the Berlin districts of Lichtenberg and Marzahn, doing my best to put together a structure that informs a system of practice. Within the waiting rooms and narrow offices of institutions serving immigrants, Roma are present and obvious, sticking out like a sore thumb without the opportunity for dialogue; they are talked about or talked around. <strong>And so one cannot talk about migration, diversity, and multicultural inclusion in Berlin without talking about how Lichtenberg talks about Roma.</strong></p>
<p>On the first Tuesday of every month, the <em><a href="http://www.migrantenrat.de/">Migrantenrat Lichtenberg</a> </em>(immigrants&#8217; plenary) meets to address issues of migration affecting the district and its neighborhoods. Tables are pushed together to frame a discussion, and the renovated walls of the Lichtenberg city hall fill with urgent  deliberation. The gospel of November&#8217;s session: <strong>The Roma are coming!</strong></p>
<p>At this month&#8217;s plenary, approx. 20 Berliners were in attendance. Based on attire and commentary, bureaucrats from the district employment office (Job Center) and volunteer representatives of  ethnic-cultural organizations of immigrant populations mingled with local political officers. The new district <a href="http://www.berlin.de/ba-lichtenberg/politik/integrationsbeauftragte01.html">commissioner for integration</a>, Bärbel Olhagaray, was presiding &#8211; speaking perfect <em>hochdeutsch, </em>pursing her lips after every third word. But <em>I am married to a Chilean</em>, she remarked in her introduction, one among many reasons why she is an advocate for immigrant integration.</p>
<div id="attachment_1761" style="width: 425px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baerbel.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1761" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1761 " src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baerbel.jpg" alt="baerbel" width="415" height="620" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baerbel.jpg 415w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baerbel-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1761" class="wp-caption-text">Frau Bärbel Olhagaray, Integration Commissioner of Lichtenberg</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.berliner-woche.de/nachrichten/bezirk-lichtenberg/artikel/29620-baerbel-olhagaray-ist-die-neue-beauftragte-fuer-integration-in-lichtenberg/">Source</a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">She offered the opening address, the title of which was &#8216;Roma in Lichtenberg&#8217;. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The speech began with numbers.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Roma number about 800 to 900 in Lichtenberg, though many, many more are to be expected. There are three apartment complexes known to house predominately Roma families in our district, characterized by negligent landlords and overpriced rent. We approached these residences as a reaction to complaints in the area. <strong>Families of 6 occupy 30 square meters for a price of 600 Euros, sleeping nearly shoulder-to-shoulder.</strong> The houses lack consistent ways to dispose of waste. Our priorities are to reinstate order and cleanliness and to visit the families regularly to see what is needed.</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1758" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl.jpg?w=640" alt="Fennpfuhl" width="640" height="382" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl.jpg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl-300x179.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fennpfuhl-650x388.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jeder-qm-du.de/platten-doku/platten-wissen/detail/wbsqp-71-r/">Source</a></p>
<p>But figures and living situations do not matter as much as Euros, at least as policy demonstrates. The economic element of Roma immigration is the primary reason the &#8216;Roma problem&#8217; has gained attention and notoriety, particularly in districts overwhelmed by rumors that may prove to be true.</p>
<p>Since Bulgaria and Romania&#8217;s entrance into the European Union&#8217;s economic area, which allows for the transference of work permission and skills from one member state to the next, only partial admission into the German job market has been granted for citizens from these countries. Citing a wave of unqualified workers, often illiterate, into a strong market-driven economy, i.e. a wave of Roma, this act of exclusion became German federal policy. According to the European Union, Germany was acting in violation of economic rules of engagement and must retract its restricted work policy for immigrants from Bulgaria and Romania at the start of 2014. This affects Roma.</p>
<p><strong><em>Most of the families are registered as self-employed</em>, Mrs. Olhagaray continued, <em>since they do not yet have the full benefits of EU citizenship, which grants them state assistance in many cases of difficulty. </em></strong>They wash windshields at traffic lights, peddle on the U-Bahn, play music in front of the mall entrance and somehow make ends meet.<em> They send most of their kids to school, as far as we are aware, and ensure that they learn German while they are there.</em></p>
<p>When she and her colleagues go by for a visit, she added, they are greeted with open arms, tea, and cake. <em>They know we are there to help them&#8230;and they need our help.</em></p>
<p>The room became silent, waiting for the evident problem to become clear.</p>
<p><strong><em>2014 will be a year of change for Roma in Berlin, primarily for those who have come from Bulgaria and Romania.</em> </strong><em><strong>They will have access to the social welfare system, the situation will change dramatically</strong>, </em>full stop.</p>

<p>Legal change may not change bureaucracy over night. In fact, it may take years until needy families receive any sort of visibility or assistance in the political arena. The <em>Migrantenrat</em> may set the agenda in the community and have an influence on local government, but laws are passed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with assisting Roma in Lichtenberg is the presence of stereotypes, seldom confirmed and often well-spread, evidenced by the contribution of one bureaucrat in employment services. Mrs. Olhagaray listened intently, as the woman &#8211; originally from Bulgaria &#8211; began to describe the situation of &#8216;<em>Zigeuner</em>&#8216; (gypsies), a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/zigeunersossen-streit-interview-mit-silvio-peritore-a-916760.html">word that has since become derogatory</a>, particularly in the culinary world. In a slight Slavic accent, she told of <strong><em>these people: stripping their living quarters of metal and valuable materials for money, over populating neighborhoods, lacking hygiene and order.</em></strong> With one finger pointed out the window at the end of the room:<em> the Pentecostal church, poverty, and illiteracy have led to too many children and no way to care for them!</em></p>
<p>But the cycle is slowly being broken. Many Roma children in Berlin are indeed going to school, and Berlin boasts <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/07/18/rave-education-per-square-kilometer/">initiatives which help them excel, as Sophia profiled back in June.</a> In many countries where Roma have lived before immigrating to Germany, school was not compulsory and in many cases was informally forbidden to them.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/roma-kids-in-school.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1759" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/roma-kids-in-school.jpg" alt="Roma kids in school" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://kubus-berlin.de/de/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/opener.jpg">Source</a></p>
<p>It seemed that our task in the <em>Migrantenrat </em>was simply to absorb the fragments of a crisis: the Roma problem unfolding like a heavy, scarlet rug out onto the plenary floor. <strong>Bureaucracy is often about working within the rules set by others, not about solving problems.</strong></p>
<p><em>But why do they come here? Why do the countries where they come from not intervene?</em>, asked a literacy volunteer in Lichtenberg schools, now working to absorb the newly-arrived children of Roma families, who may have never seen a book in their home but <em>come eagerly to learn, nonetheless, </em>she shared.</p>
<p>Without <a href="http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/413-EU-MIDIS_ROMA_EN.pdf">the story of systemic segregation and discrimination</a> behind the Roma (and Sinti) experience in Europe, answering this question is a difficult task. The situation becomes one of economics and not of humanism or even moral action &#8211; something enshrined in Germany&#8217;s constitution under its provisions for asylum and human rights.</p>
<p><em>So, if they can now access social services like any other EU-citizen, how many are expected to come?</em>, asked a representative from the Russian community, his voice lightened by compassion, though cut with a hint of anxiety.</p>
<p><em>Many</em>, was the message, <em>simply thousands</em>. With some other countries <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/opinion/02garcia.html?_r=2&amp;ref=romanipeople&amp;">forcefully rejecting Roma and clearing settlements, as in France</a>, Germany, especially Berlin, will become key destinations in the future.</p>
<p>Fortunately, social work agencies for immigrant populations have developed many projects for Roma-related challenges in Berlin, long before the problem was as acute as it is now. Talking to a <a href="http://www.dicvberlin.caritas.de/">Caritas </a>social worker from my fieldwork, I was told that it was the NGOs and not the government who pushed for <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/18/review-become-a-german/">integration courses</a> to contain a path to literacy. <strong><em>How are they meant to learn German and get a job if they do not know the alphabet, we thought, so we asked for 900 hours of instruction instead of just 600, where they at least have a chance</em>,</strong> she said, exasperated.  <em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Another Caritas colleague was present at the <em>Migrantenrat </em>on this November day.  She sat quietly next to me, taking few notes, her arms crossed. As a social worker with more knowledge of German immigration and employment laws than any bureaucrat I have ever met, she looked a bit frustrated at the shock and awe that surrounding the discussion of a so-called impending crisis.</p>
<p>At the end of the plenary, she turned to me: <strong><em>This problem has been here a long time, we have been telling them&#8230;they didn&#8217;t listen.</em></strong></p>
<p>I turned off my recorder. After reviewing the sound bites from the evening, one thing was clear: Of course, the Roma are coming. Why wouldn&#8217;t they? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrgnkd-Lsl8">Everyone is coming to Berlin.</a> This time, however, these people are not starving artists but rather a persecuted minority, seeking everything they have been denied. Even bureaucrats know that.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p>There is no single <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/06/01/happy-weekend-a-roma-reimage/">Roma identity</a> or one Roma community, but for starters, some further resources are in order. Roma in Berlin: <a href="http://www.sinti-roma-berlin.de/">Landesverband Deutscher Sinti und Roma Berlin-Brandenburg e.V</a>., the German Roma and Sinti <a href="http://www.sintiundroma.de/start.html">documentation and educational center </a>for current debates and cultural awareness in Heidelberg, the European Union&#8217;s <a href="http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/413-EU-MIDIS_ROMA_EN.pdf">report on discrimination against Roma</a>. Finally, the <a href="http://www.migrantenrat.de/"><em>Migrantenrat Lichtenberg</em></a> is open to the public, if further discussions involving Roma and district politics happen to be of interest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Punctual. Exact. Productive. Closed off. Careful. Inflexible. Humorless.&#8221; And some &#8220;Goethe&#8221; and &#8220;Einstein&#8221; thrown in for good measure. Was this really all a group of seemingly well-educated professionals had to say about <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/25/rave-why-remembering-the-holocaust-is-good-for-immigrants/">German identity</a>? No wonder the facilitator had started to draw sad faces on the list.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-08-14-16-29-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1682" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-08-14-16-29-1.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-11-08 14.16.29-1" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p><em>My hands get sweaty when I hear this sort of talk</em>, a woman piped up from the front row, a shred of anger in her voice. <em>Is this really all we identify with, as Germans?</em></p>
<p>I shared her frustration. We were over three hours into the &#8220;German Identity and Identities in Germany&#8221; workshop, having already watched a documentary clip and listened to a panel discussion on the nuances of (im)migration, national identity, and belonging. Yet when asked by our facilitator <em>What is German?</em>, all we could come up with were stereotypes or nothing at all. I was in the latter camp, sitting quietly in the corner, scribbling down notes, the occasional eyebrow raise or eye roll gracing my face. An older man on the other side of the room began criticizing globalization and everything &#8220;becoming the same&#8221;, proclaiming that when it comes down to it, identity is tied to region. <em>I have fire in my belly,</em> my friend whispered to me, leaning over. <em>So do I</em>, I thought, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with it. On some level our hybrid-identities felt under attack, as if our <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/26/lens-coming-home/">sense of home</a> tied to people, language, and experience was not as legitimate as one tied to geography. As if we weren&#8217;t quite part of the discussion in the same way as the others.</p>
<div id="attachment_1683" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-08-15-31-39-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1683" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1683" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-08-15-31-39-1.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-11-08 15.31.39-1" width="640" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1683" class="wp-caption-text">Making friends at the workshop</p></div>
<p>I was surprised at myself. For years I&#8217;d been navigating a slew of cultures, confidently code-switching, getting by and blending in pretty much anywhere with relative ease and advantage. Dual citizen, trilingual, well-traveled, ethnically ambiguous, international education professional, American-German-Jewish-Algerian mutt. I&#8217;d always felt <em>just different enough</em>, rather than <em>too different</em>. I&#8217;m a pretty ruthless cherry-picker, highlighting a particular part of my background when it suits the moment. <em>My dad&#8217;s Jewish and I went on Birthright</em>, I declare to Israeli airport security. <em>My mom&#8217;s German and I&#8217;m a dual citizen,</em> I respond when asked why I live in Berlin. <em>I&#8217;m part Algerian</em>, I say proudly to a cute Arab-German on a date. <em>I also grew up with two languages and have trouble with German</em>, I share with the Vietnamese girls I tutor. I&#8217;d positioned my international identity as the centerpiece of my life a long time ago, letting it guide me both personally and professionally. Perhaps it&#8217;s self-serving or even greedy, but it&#8217;s always felt like my choice.</p>
<p>Others have their choice ripped from them with one ostensibly innocent question: &#8220;<strong>But where are you from from?&#8221; </strong><em><strong>Wo kommst du wirklich her? </strong></em>Translation: &#8220;You must come from somewhere other than here, because you look/sound/pray/move/eat/celebrate differently than <em>we</em> do.&#8221; The plight of the &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWynJkN5HbQ">perpetual foreigner</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>During my past two years in Berlin I&#8217;d started to get a little taste of what that felt like, an after-taste really. <em>No, I&#8217;m not Spanish</em>, I find myself saying at least once a week to those who wonder out-loud or even just start speaking to me in Spanish. I get it, there are an increasing number of Spaniards in Berlin (and Germany). I get it, I have darker features. But whereas I would normally enjoy talking about my background, I now find myself getting irritated and defensive having to explain myself against a recurrent assumption.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;People always ask how my German is so good. I tell them I&#8217;ll try to speak worse German from now on,&#8221; a Vietnamese immigrant says ironically in his studio.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I know people expect me to be a certain way, or have ideas about what type of person I am, of what I&#8217;m capable of, based on how I look,&#8221; a young Eritrean girl ponders at the window.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really Turkish, and I&#8217;m not really German. I identify as a Turkish-German, which is something else,&#8221; reflects a woman from her apartment.<br />
</em></p>

<p>While the woman with the sweaty hands was perhaps frustrated by the selection of adjectives on the list, I realized I was worked up about why there had to be a list at all. For the first time in two years in Berlin, I not only wondered, but cared, whether the others in the room considered me German. Or even German enough.</p>
<p><em>I grew up with German culture, speak the language, have the passport, and now live here</em>, I finally summoned up the courage and coherence to say. <em>But I&#8217;m only one fourth German &#8220;ethnically&#8221;. I know people back in the US who have more German blood than I but have no connection to the country, language, people, history. I don&#8217;t fit everything on that list, but neither do any of you.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Identity is a social construction, I wanted to go on. A fluid and on-going process on both the individual and national level. Increased levels of migration and diversity often spark an instinct to distinguish, retreat, and protect- on both the &#8220;native&#8221; and &#8220;(im)migrant&#8221; sides. But it&#8217;s also an opportunity to reflect, learn, and reinvent. By the end of the workshop, we were getting there.</p>
<p><em>What is your vision for a modern perception of &#8220;Germanness&#8221;?</em> the facilitator prompted us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being open. Intercultural understanding from authorities. Focusing on plurality. Promoting language proficiency. Fostering awareness. Accepting (not only tolerating) others. Self-reflection.&#8221;</p>
<p>A list of adjectives can only put us into a box. A list of actions lets us move forward.</p>
<p>&#8211; <em>By <strong>Sophia Burton</strong></em></p>
<p><em>How serendipitous: a fantastic article on the same topic just came out in Spiegel. Read <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/essay-on-racism-growing-up-turkish-in-germany-a-932154.html">here</a> about one woman&#8217;s reality of growing up as a third-generation Turkish-German in Hamburg and being asked about everything from circumcision, staying out late, and being a &#8220;different Turk&#8221;. </em></p>
<p><em>The documentary clip we watched is from &#8220;with WINGS and ROOTS&#8221; that juxtaposes the realities of (im)migrant life, national identity, and belonging in Berlin and New York City. You can watch the trailer <a href="http://www.withwingsandroots.com/video/trailer">here</a> and <strong>support the project <a href="http://www.withwingsandroots.com/get-involved/donate">here</a></strong><strong>.</strong> According to representatives from the film at the workshop there will be new ways of getting involved in January, so stay tuned! </em></p>
