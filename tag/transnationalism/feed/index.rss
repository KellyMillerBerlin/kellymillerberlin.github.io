<p>Vienna. Seat of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Widely considered the gateway to Eastern Europe. Home to a United Nations headquarters and numerous international companies and universities. The Austrian capital has long been a city of immigration – even when politics have told a different story – and a staggering <a href="https://www.wien.gv.at/english/social/integration/basic-work/facts-figures.html">50% of the population</a> has what’s referred to as a “migration background”.</p>
<p>So it’s not as if I expected Vienna to <em>not</em> be multicultural.</p>
<p>What I didn’t expect when <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2015/03/23/lens-on-leaving-homes/">moving to Vienna from Berlin</a> was to encounter some of the most fascinating “mixes” of my life: A half-Indian, half-Italian who grew up in the US and lives in Vienna with her half-Austrian, half-French boyfriend? A Chinese-American who fell in love with her German boyfriend in Hong Kong? A half-Austrian, half-Sicilian who met her Indian husband in London? The combinations are unexpected, beautiful, and dare I say, collidoscopic? (And their potential future children even more so).</p>
<div id="attachment_4031" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4031" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4031 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender3-650x475.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender(3)" width="650" height="475" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender3-650x475.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender3-300x219.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender3.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4031" class="wp-caption-text">Christina poses with a cow in Austria on a family roadtrip</p></div>
<p>Christina, the first close friend I made in Vienna, is no different. Born in Taiwan to a Taiwanese mother and Austrian father, at age three her family moved to San Jose, California, where her younger brother was born. Kindergarten was spent in Vienna, where she lived with her father and grandparents while mom and brother stayed in the US. At age six the entire family moved to Taiwan for four years. Then it was back west to Seattle from ages 10-16 where Christina spent the longest stretch of her childhood, what she calls her &#8220;most formative years&#8221;. Her last two years of high school were completed in Taipei, where she graduated with the globally recognized International Baccalaureate Diploma.</p>
<p>“I was missing roots as a kid, our family was always bouncing around,&#8221; she tells me.</p>
<p>This triangular ping ponging between nations resulted in three different passport combinations within a family of four: Christina’s brother, born in the US, is a dual Austrian-American citizen but “avoids Austria now because of the mandatory military service.” Mom is dual Taiwanese-Austrian, “but never felt completely comfortable in Austria”. And Christina and her father are purely Austrian, on paper anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;A long time ago my dad had the chance to become an American citizen but decided against it,&#8221; she says smirking, &#8220;He&#8217;s a proud Austrian.”</p>
<div id="attachment_4057" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9365.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4057" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4057 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9365-650x488.jpg" alt="IMG_9365" width="650" height="488" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9365-650x488.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9365-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9365-80x60.jpg 80w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9365.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4057" class="wp-caption-text">Christina with her parents in Taiwan</p></div>
<p>It is to her father and his “pride” that Christina attributes her last 16 years in Vienna. &#8220;My dream was to go to Georgetown [University],&#8221; Christina tells me one warm evening in the <em>Museumsquartier</em>, her fingers tapping the stem of her <em>Hugospritz</em>. &#8220;I applied and got in… my mom supported it, but my dad kept saying I had to go to university in Austria. It was always really important to him that, as the oldest child, I embrace my Austrian roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christina ended up moving to Vienna against her will: “I didn&#8217;t have any connection to Austria at that time other than having spent the occasional summer there with my grandparents.” The first year, she expressed her anger by skipping class in favor of exploring the city and having fun.</p>
<p>“And then I got pregnant,” she says laughing, “the biggest rebellion of all!”</p>
<div id="attachment_4059" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9371.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4059" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4059 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9371-650x650.jpg" alt="IMG_9371" width="650" height="650" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9371.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_9371-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4059" class="wp-caption-text">Mother-daughter surfing trip in Morocco</p></div>
<p>Christina’s daughter Illeana (Illy) was born when she was 20. She raised Illy as a single mother while completing her degrees in Economics and Sinology, with “lots of help” from friends with similar bi-cultural backgrounds. She counts half-Austrian friends from South Africa and Bolivia among her closest, along with a half-Kosovan, half-Czech hair salon owner named Suzi. “None of us knew what we were doing… it was experimental parenting. I think if I raised a child now I’d be much more nervous!”</p>
<p>After making it over the hump of her first year, Vienna started to feel like home. “I began to realize how much I love it here,” Christina reflects. Now one could say Christina is as Austrian as they come. Her German is flawless and chock full of colloquialisms, she sings along to Austrian <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music">Schlager</a></em>, and her drink of choice is the ubiquitous <em><a href="http://austrianwineusa.com/2013/12/20/12-days-of-austrian-wine-enjoy-a-gspritzer/">Weisser Spritzer</a></em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4064" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender7.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4064" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4064 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender7-650x602.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender(7)" width="650" height="602" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender7-650x602.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender7-300x278.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender7.jpg 701w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4064" class="wp-caption-text">Christina skiing in Kaprun, Austria</p></div>
<p>None of that, however, stops her from craving Taiwanese ‘Three-Cups Chicken’ or her favorite American cereal, ‘Lucky Charms’. “I’m biracial and tri-cultural,” she states without hesitation. And while rewarding on personal and professional levels (she’s also fluent in Mandarin), Christina’s background has not gone unchallenged in a city that still struggles to see itself as a place of migration and diversity.</p>
<p>Christina has encountered countless variations of the “<a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/11/11/lens-with-wings-roots-and-sweaty-hands/">But where are you <em>really</em> from?</a>” question over the years. “When I first got to Vienna, there were fewer minorities and diversity didn&#8217;t work very well,” she remarks, “I remember meeting one guy who could not comprehend why I looked the way I did but had a very common German last name,&#8221; she rolls her eyes at the memory. &#8220;I literally had to spell it out for him by saying, &#8216;If you, an Austrian, had a baby with a Taiwanese woman, the result would be me!’”</p>
<div id="attachment_4034" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4034" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4034 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender6-650x488.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender(6)" width="650" height="488" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender6-650x488.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender6-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender6-80x60.jpg 80w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender6.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4034" class="wp-caption-text">Christina&#8217;s 3rd Birthday in Los Angeles, California</p></div>
<p>This phenomenon isn’t limited to Vienna. In Japan, a newly crowned biracial beauty queen has been fielding questions on a regular basis about what parts of her are “Japanese”. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/world/asia/biracial-beauty-queen-strives-for-change-in-mono-ethnic-japan.html">“But I am a Japanese,”</a> is her response. On the other side of the world, in the US, Rachel Dolezal was recently exposed for her elaborate deception as a Black woman – a &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/opinion/charles-blow-the-delusions-of-dolezal.html?smid=fb-share">one-directional privilege</a>&#8221; that could never have been successful the other way around, due to socially constructed perceptions of race. The recurring theme? If you are one drop of minority, we will question your Belonging to the majority.</p>
<p>Christina acknowledges that even she is not immune to societal attitudes about migrants in Austria. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned that, in Austria, migrants get classified into &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217;,&#8221; she explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asians are considered ‘good’ because they’re quiet, stay out of trouble, and work hard. Turkish people are unpopular because a lot of them refuse to adapt to the Austrian way of life and bring hordes of family members over, all the while claiming benefits from the Austrian government. Blacks have it the worst, though, probably because they stand out the most and are still viewed by many locals as low-lifes and drug dealers.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_4029" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4029" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4029 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender1-650x472.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender(1)" width="650" height="472" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender1-650x472.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender1-300x218.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4029" class="wp-caption-text">Christina riding a (fake) bull at Glacier National Park, Montana</p></div>
<p>While Christina is well aware that the US has its own challenges regarding diversity, she does view it as more progressive: “In the US, people at least get it when you tell them that you&#8217;re biracial.”</p>
<p>It was 1999 when Christina was last in the US, before Illy&#8217;s birth and before the 9/11 attacks. While she’s now seriously considering a move back, it&#8217;s unclear when she will be able to. Christina is not a US citizen and needs a green card. Her most recent attempt at the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/immigrate/diversity-visa/instructions.html">Diversity Visa Lottery</a> was unsuccessful. “My dad told me he is reconsidering becoming an American citizen just so that he can help get us over there,” Christina recently shared. <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/family-reunification">Family reunification</a> is one of the four major pathways for foreigners to become legal residents of the US.</p>
<p>Legal challenges are also not Christina’s only concern. “Sometimes I worry that people in the US will annoy me with their ignorance,” she says laughing. At the same time, she is drawn to the lifestyle. She observes her American friends move to houses with pools, which, compared to Viennese city apartments, seem like mansions. Illy, a recovering Justin Bieber addict who recently graduated to a One Direction obsession, is thrilled with the prospect. “A typical Austrian teenager,” Christina chuckles.</p>
<p>You could call Christina many things: A transnational, an immigrant, <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/10/18/interview-tv-the-treasury-minister-and-third-culture-kids/">a third-culture kid</a>, a foreigner, a native, an expat. But none of these categories really fit given the fluidity of her upbringing and identity. We use labels to establish connections and try to make sense of things, but they can also dilute the intricacy and beauty of reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not 100% of anything,&#8221; is how Christina describes it. &#8220;Sometimes when people ask what I am, I just answer that I&#8217;m a human being.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last month, Kelly wrote about the implications of &#8220;<a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2015/02/13/lens-leaving-berlin/">collecting ourselves</a>&#8221; to make a move back home. While wrought with complications in its own right, returning to where one grew up, has family, or holds full political and legal rights is a move that Makes Sense. One chapter closes, and however painful or messy, the next begins.</p>
<p>After graduate school, I started losing the ability to picture my life in chapters. My decisions were no longer dictated by a series of steps culminating in clear milestones. I suddenly felt accosted by the need to figure out what I wanted to Do and Be&#8230; this time for the long run. And, given my international experiences and dual citizenship, the question of &#8220;What&#8221; promptly extended to one of &#8220;Where&#8221;.</p>
<p>So I moved to Berlin.</p>
<p>When I booked my flight to Germany in fall 2011, &#8220;two years&#8221; was my default timeline. &#8220;A couple years,&#8221; I responded confidently when someone asked how long I planned to be gone. &#8220;I should give the job a good two years,&#8221; I thought when I got hired six months in. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all still be here at least two more years,&#8221; I reassured myself about my circle of expat* friends another six months after that.</p>
<p>How foolish I was, to believe that two years would ever be enough. How <span class="st">naïve</span>,<em> </em>to assume there would be a clear demarcation between this chapter and the next.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-01-31-14.28.03-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3885 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-01-31-14.28.03-1-650x487.jpg" alt="2015-01-31 14.28.03-1" width="650" height="487" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-01-31-14.28.03-1-650x487.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-01-31-14.28.03-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-01-31-14.28.03-1-80x60.jpg 80w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-01-31-14.28.03-1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Now almost three and a half years in, I feel firmly entrenched in my world of bilingual conversations, narrow streets, weekend jaunts around the continent, ubiquitous public transport, social welfare nets, and crusty bread. But these roots of mine are flighty. They wiggle at something as simple as a chat with a friend back home, when she catches me up on her life and I realize how much I&#8217;ve missed. When my sister or father leaves for the airport after a visit, they are pulled halfway out of the earth and end up lodged in the middle of my throat. Every time I get on a plane and head back across the ocean, a part of me fears they will be ripped out entirely. Because no matter how long I stay in Europe and embrace the rights my German passport affords me, I will always also be American. No matter how incredible a life I build for myself on this side of the Atlantic, there will always be a Life Back Home.</p>
<p>I was not aware of how much I had internalized this feeling until last summer, when my mother and I visited relatives in northwestern Germany. Sipping coffee on a sunny terrace, a family friend commented, &#8220;I could never do what you&#8217;re doing, be so far away from my family&#8230; I&#8217;m too close to them.&#8221; My reaction to her declaration was nothing short of primal. Of course I missed my family! Of course I felt close to them! I was not away <em>because</em> of, but rather, <em>in spite of</em> them &#8211; an unpleasant reality I struggle with on a near daily basis.</p>

<p>Modern advances in travel and technology have enabled more and more people to adopt lifestyles fueled by wanderlust and adventure. But not all of us who leave home are <a href="http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/wanderlust-like-travel-much-no-real-home/959705/">perpetual wanderers with nomadic spirits</a>. Some of us are searching for somewhere to settle. Some of us are even surprised to find ourselves making a life away from where we grew up, away from the ones we love. I know I am.</p>
<p>I consider myself, by nature, to be a sensitive homebody. I crave being close to the people I love and place great importance on maintaining my relationships, both near and far. This explains why any time I am &#8220;away&#8221;, my pack mentality kicks in and I seek out a local community almost immediately. But I concurrently possess the intrinsic need to push myself and explore. For me, this has meant travel. Whether I credit <a href="https://psychologyblogaimee.wordpress.com/2013/12/04/wanderlust-a-genetic-basis-to-a-globetrotting-fanatic/">genetics</a> for this (nope) or my international upbringing, mixed with a little courage and a lot of privilege (that&#8217;s more like it), is not the point. The ups and downs of living somewhere other than where I grew up have become an integral part of my identity and understanding of growth and independence. They just don&#8217;t make the leaving part any easier.</p>
<p>The thing is, leaving is rarely the easy choice, even with the prospect of Something Great on the other side.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-21-16.37.36-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3887 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-21-16.37.36-1-650x487.jpg" alt="2015-02-21 16.37.36-1" width="650" height="487" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-21-16.37.36-1-650x487.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-21-16.37.36-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-21-16.37.36-1-80x60.jpg 80w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-21-16.37.36-1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>While I never expected moving to Berlin to be easy, I did anticipate a gradual ease, and more importantly, clarity, with time. Reality proved instead to be emphatically non-linear. Rough patches hit me sporadically and without warning. My homesickness became a swelling wave, pulling in and out of shore, threatening at its peak to wash me out entirely. What if this chapter never ended? What if I never left my new home and went back to my old one? And now that I live in Vienna, my current home because of work, is my &#8220;old home&#8221; Washington, DC or Berlin? In countless discussions with fellow expat friends on the topics of home and belonging, the resounding theme has been similar: one of overwhelming choice and uncertainty.</p>
<p>A couple months ago, Kelly and I were at a close friend&#8217;s 30th birthday dinner in Berlin. Huddled in the kitchen over bottles of Spanish Temperanillo and mismatched plates of pizza and crudit<span class="st">és</span>, someone proposed we guess where the birthday boy would be 30 years from now. We had plenty of ideas for the &#8220;What&#8221;: running his own cooking school, teaching his kids how to do science experiments, maintaining his impressive beard. It was on the &#8220;Where&#8221; that we got stuck. &#8220;Italy?&#8221; we posed as the obvious choice (where he&#8217;s from). He resolutely shook his head &#8220;no&#8221;. &#8220;Germany?&#8221; He shrugged his shoulders, unsure &#8211; just like the majority of us in the room about our own futures.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve opened yourself up to the world and seen first-hand that you can live, and maybe even thrive, somewhere else, it becomes increasingly difficult to know when or where to stop searching. The list of potential Something Greats becomes never-ending. And with it, the accompanying list of goodbyes.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In a capital city marked by transformation and transience, where people are perpetually coming and going, it can feel like a true rarity to meet someone actually <em>from</em> that city.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8221; was my first Berlin friend from Berlin. We met through a language website, after she sent me a request to practice French in exchange for German. H was working on her degree to become a French teacher. I was still new to the city and could count my local friends on one hand. The first time we hung out was in February 2012 at a cafe under the <em>Savignyplatz S-Bahn</em> arches. H ended up helping me with my research on teacher quality in Germany, and I gave her tips for her upcoming study abroad program in France. Soon enough our linguistic meet-ups evolved into a friendship that waved off grammar practice in favor of relaxed Sunday afternoon coffee dates.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our relationship also became a kind of exchange of culinary cultures. I started joining her annually to break the fast during Ramadan. As the resident atheist I wouldn&#8217;t fast before these meals. Yet I&#8217;d still be the one gnawing away at my fingers until sundown, while H and her sisters waited patiently for their first sips of rose flavored water and soup drizzled with fresh lemon juice. In return, H  joined my international crew of friends for her first Thanksgiving dinner, initiated into the world of cranberry sauce, candied sweet potatoes, and general American gluttony. Her contribution &#8211; mounds of Turkish <em>Lahmacun</em> (spiced lamb pizza) &#8211; was eagerly divvied up like party favors at the end of the night.</p>
<div id="attachment_3611" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_3340.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3611" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3611 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_3340-650x650.jpg" alt="IMG_3340" width="650" height="650" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_3340.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_3340-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3611" class="wp-caption-text">Ramadan dinner with H</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">It didn&#8217;t take long for us to discover our mutual fascination with questions of citizenship and identity. We attended several events together on the topic and often spent our cafe time discussing our hybrid families and understanding of <em>Deutschsein</em> or &#8220;Germanness&#8221;. See, while H is a true <em>Berlinerin</em> &#8211; she was born and grew up here &#8211; her parents are from Tunisia. We shared the feeling of having more than one home; while I straddled the Atlantic, H had a foot on either side of the Mediterranean. But unlike me, H had grown up with the challenge of having to persistently defend her Germanness, to the wider community and to her own parents.</p>
<p>In countries like Germany that are still embracing their multicultural identities &#8211; Germany first recognized itself as a country of immigration in 2005 &#8211; too many still have a binary understanding of native vs. foreigner that acknowledges bloodlines over birthplace and physical appearance over personal identity. There remains a habit of probing those who look &#8220;different&#8221; about their roots, otherwise known as the dreaded &#8220;But where are you <em>really</em> from?&#8221; <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/11/11/lens-with-wings-roots-and-sweaty-hands/">question</a>. Those on the receiving end of this question are often referred to as the &#8220;perpetual foreigner&#8221;, ethnic minorities who will always be seen as the “other” because of how they look.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In H&#8217;s case, it didn&#8217;t take long to notice that the vast majority of those she came across assumed she was Turkish, including other Turkish-Germans. &#8220;Oh right, the Turkish one,&#8221; a girl on her basketball team responded, when I introduced myself as H&#8217;s friend. H once told me she gets asked if she&#8217;s Turkish more than her best friend, an actual Turkish-German who happens to be blond and fair-skinned.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-01-19-17.26.48.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3697 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-01-19-17.26.48-650x487.jpg" alt="2014-01-19 17.26.48" width="650" height="487" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-01-19-17.26.48-650x487.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-01-19-17.26.48-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-01-19-17.26.48-80x60.jpg 80w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-01-19-17.26.48.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>The confusion isn&#8217;t all too surprising, considering H&#8217;s darker features, for one, and the demographics of the city, for two. Turkish-Germans are the city&#8217;s largest ethnic minority and the largest community of Turks outside of Turkey. Estimates of the number of Turks in Berlin range from 200,000-500,000 (a combination of those with Turkish passports, partial Turkish ancestry, and ethnic minorities from Turkey). A far cry from the approximately <a href="http://www.berlin.de/lb/intmig/statistik/demografie/einwohner_staatsangehoerigkeit.html">1,500 Tunisian nationals</a> in Berlin.</p>
<p>The story of H&#8217;s parents also mirrors that of many Turkish-Germans. They immigrated to the city separately as part of a guest-worker program in the 1970s and met on the job at corporate giant, Siemens. Originally, they planned to return to Tunisia together. The couple worked 2-3 jobs, sending remittances to family in Tunisia to save up to build a house there. They sent their 3 eldest daughters back for 9 years to live with relatives and go to school. But when Germany tightened family reunification laws in the 80&#8217;s, excluding those older than 16 without German citizenship, they brought the 3 girls back to Berlin to keep the family together, by then consisting of 5 daughters.</p>
<p>H is daughter number 4 and has only visited Tunisia on vacation. She admits that a distinction exists between the older and younger sisters, due to this geographic divide in upbringing, especially apparent in attitudes toward the headscarf and family planning. Her oldest sister &#8220;lives by the Qu&#8217;ran&#8221; and hopes to move back to Tunisia permanently one day. H, on the other hand, identifies as a &#8220;<em>Berlinerin</em> with Tunisian roots&#8221;; she has no intention of leaving Germany anytime soon.</p>
<div id="attachment_3791" style="width: 657px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/htunisia.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3791" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3791 size-full" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/htunisia.jpg" alt="htunisia" width="647" height="484" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/htunisia.jpg 647w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/htunisia-300x224.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/htunisia-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3791" class="wp-caption-text">H on vacation in Tunisia</p></div>
<p>When it comes to questions and comments about her being Turkish, I&#8217;ve only ever seen H respond with patience and grace. It&#8217;s the difficulties with her own parents, and especially mother, that affect her most. If you ask her about her upbringing, H will tell you that her parents were &#8220;pretty modern for immigrant standards&#8221;, letting her play sports and stay out with friends until 10pm. Sleepovers and clubs weren&#8217;t allowed, but H found ways around her parents&#8217; rules, such as working at social events like the <em>Volksfest </em>and later heading west to Dortmund for university.</p>
<p>Boyfriends, on the other hand, were out of the question. Particularly those outside of the Tunisian-German community. H dated a little in secret, but didn&#8217;t get serious with anyone until she met &#8220;A&#8221; at 19. At 28, A was almost a decade older and managing a series of internet cafes. The flirtation started small with jokes at the shop, building up slowly to weekend jogs together. Finally, A asked H out on a date.</p>
<p>H managed to keep the relationship hidden from her parents for 6 years. &#8220;I was sure they&#8217;d disapprove because he&#8217;s Turkish,&#8221; she explains. Even though both Tunisians and Turks in Germany are predominantly Muslim, H says it&#8217;s not uncommon for the older immigrant generations to be prejudiced against one another. &#8220;The Tunisians here think that all Turkish boys are in gangs, are loud and have no respect, and don&#8217;t achieve anything,&#8221; H claims; &#8220;Tunisians in Tunisia think more positively about Turks than Tunisians in Germany do.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she told her parents about the relationship in 2013, her mother threatened that H was &#8220;ruining her life&#8221; and that if she continued, they would disown her. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t even told them yet that A is Shiite,&#8221; H joked (her family is Sunni).</p>
<div id="attachment_3792" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AH.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3792" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3792 size-large" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AH-650x202.jpg" alt="A&amp;H" width="650" height="202" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AH-650x202.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AH-300x93.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AH.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3792" class="wp-caption-text">A &amp; H</p></div>
<p>According to H, the problem is her mother&#8217;s stubbornness more than anything else. But listening to the stories one can&#8217;t help but notice an underlying theme of fear, logical or not. A fear of losing one&#8217;s child. A fear of not relating to one&#8217;s grandchildren. A fear of the dilution of one&#8217;s cultural lineage over generations. &#8220;Many in the Tunisian-German community are scared that their kids will marry Turks and end up in Turkey,&#8221; H agrees, &#8220;my mother is also afraid her grandchildren will never learn Arabic.&#8221; H and her sisters speak strictly Tunisian Arabic with their parents. When just amongst each other, a mix of Arabic and German.</p>
<p>Language is just one question of many that H and A will face as parents. They have already decided that A will primarily speak Turkish and H mostly German, which she is more comfortable with than Arabic. They have even talked about where they will <em>really</em> end up one day. H tells me that the Tunisian consulate pays for the bodies of Tunisian nationals in Germany to be sent back for burials. A, who came to Berlin at 18 as a student, gave up his Turkish passport to become German.  As an entrepreneur he&#8217;s eager to launch projects in Turkey and maybe even retire there one day, but is limited without citizenship.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After months of not seeing each other, H and I finally find time last November for one of our Sunday coffee dates. H arrives to the Italian cafe in an uncharacteristically bulky sweater that makes me raise my eyebrows. Shortly after ordering our lattes and chocolate cake, she spills the beans: she and A have gotten married, and she&#8217;s newly pregnant. The religious ceremony was held at their apartment with an Imam presiding and a handful of their closest friends and siblings present. H&#8217;s parents chose not to return early from their vacation in Tunisia to attend. As for their upcoming grandchild, wherever he or she decides to be &#8220;<em>really</em> from&#8221;, they are still in the dark.</p>

<p><strong>A couple months ago, Collidoscope Berlin was invited to write its first guest post for the <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=34e2670d2b1df6a04603724fa&amp;id=3a6a8f6948&amp;e=b0926c0e88">Global Citizens Initiative</a> </strong>&#8211; an organization that aims &#8220;to build a network of people who see themselves as global citizens and want to build a better world&#8221;. Part of the task was to connect what we do here to the significance of borders. &#8220;Borders?&#8221;, we wondered, unsure how to proceed but mostly questioning why we had never concretely addressed the topic before. What kind of immigration project doesn&#8217;t discuss borders?</p>
<p>When we launched this project in April of last year, we knew we wanted to do something <em>different </em>related to the topic of<em> difference. </em>We knew of groups that promoted and celebrated cultural and ethnic diversity. We had worked for institutions that research and analyze immigrant integration. Our goal was to do something in between, producing articles and commentary that both told a story and provided facts and context. And we wanted to do this through the lens of one city that, although formed by a unique historical and political context, could perhaps provide lessons for others.</p>
<p><strong>A few days ago, Collidoscope Berlin turned one-year old </strong>&#8211; and as we took the opportunity to reflect back, we realized that not talking about borders was, in fact, making a statement about borders. It wasn&#8217;t that we thought borders were unimportant or that we were advocating their complete erosion. Rather, we were advocating for the idea that every city <span style="letter-spacing: 0;">is home to its very own “collision” of cultures and thus has <em>unique</em> stories about diversity and difference. Through the lens of migration &#8211; the movement and coming together of people &#8211; we believe that we can understand more about what makes &#8216;us&#8217; who we are on the individual, local, and global scales. Through our personal lens of moving and living across borders, we aim to make sense of what defines and shapes the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/26/lens-coming-home/">places we call home</a>, as well as the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/16/lens-going-away/">places we leave</a>. Cities, as a reflection of &#8216;the we&#8217;, are a good place to start.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Collidoscope Manifesto </strong></span></p>
<p><em>Originally published as a guest post for the <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=34e2670d2b1df6a04603724fa&amp;id=3a6a8f6948&amp;e=b0926c0e88">Global Citizens Initiative</a><strong><br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>Individuals are born within borders. On a map, these borders seem relatively arbitrary: meandering lines awkwardly encircling blurbs of land. And yet in our lives, the purpose they are meant to serve is anything but, as borders demarcate political, legal, and bureaucratic spaces, as much as they do geographic ones. For it is not geography &#8211; the land itself &#8211; that keeps us from coming and going. It is our (hu)man-made political systems and governments that determine who is permitted to enter or leave, to immigrate or emigrate, to belong or not to belong.</p>
<p>Despite the presence of these borders, we all make our way across these lines one way or another. Whether through relationships abroad, use of technology, involvement in international groups, or participation in the global economy: our lives are increasingly global and less tied to the borders in which we were born or reside. While this does not automatically make us all global citizens (which necessitates awareness and action), it fosters connections across borders that reinforce the idea of a world community. How can we reconcile this ever-present reality with our understanding of borders and restrictions on an individual’s freedom of movement?</p>
<p>The majority of us – more than ever before &#8211; lives in cities. Thanks largely to migration, modern cities have become microcosms of the global community, home to spectacular cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity. While this “collision” of cultures can pose challenges, it is also a tremendous opportunity for growth and enrichment. If we begin to view our cities’ pockets and spaces of difference as opportunities – becoming more empathetic, inclusive, and participatory in the process – we can begin to realize global values within local communities.</p>

<p>Berlin, Germany is one example: a city with a long history of attracting those who are “different”, where 1 in every 4 residents is of foreign origin and 138 countries are represented. A city that is undergoing constant transformation, while undertaking the challenge of integrating not only newcomers, but the 2nd and 3rd generations. A city that is brimming with rich diversity and teeming with opportunities. <span style="letter-spacing: 0;">Collidoscope Berlin is a celebration of these stories and opportunities, a conversation-starter, a democratic and inclusive view of the many peoples, spaces, and settings that constitute the modern city. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Punctual. Exact. Productive. Closed off. Careful. Inflexible. Humorless.&#8221; And some &#8220;Goethe&#8221; and &#8220;Einstein&#8221; thrown in for good measure. Was this really all a group of seemingly well-educated professionals had to say about <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/25/rave-why-remembering-the-holocaust-is-good-for-immigrants/">German identity</a>? No wonder the facilitator had started to draw sad faces on the list.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-08-14-16-29-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1682" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-08-14-16-29-1.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-11-08 14.16.29-1" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p><em>My hands get sweaty when I hear this sort of talk</em>, a woman piped up from the front row, a shred of anger in her voice. <em>Is this really all we identify with, as Germans?</em></p>
<p>I shared her frustration. We were over three hours into the &#8220;German Identity and Identities in Germany&#8221; workshop, having already watched a documentary clip and listened to a panel discussion on the nuances of (im)migration, national identity, and belonging. Yet when asked by our facilitator <em>What is German?</em>, all we could come up with were stereotypes or nothing at all. I was in the latter camp, sitting quietly in the corner, scribbling down notes, the occasional eyebrow raise or eye roll gracing my face. An older man on the other side of the room began criticizing globalization and everything &#8220;becoming the same&#8221;, proclaiming that when it comes down to it, identity is tied to region. <em>I have fire in my belly,</em> my friend whispered to me, leaning over. <em>So do I</em>, I thought, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with it. On some level our hybrid-identities felt under attack, as if our <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/26/lens-coming-home/">sense of home</a> tied to people, language, and experience was not as legitimate as one tied to geography. As if we weren&#8217;t quite part of the discussion in the same way as the others.</p>
<div id="attachment_1683" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-08-15-31-39-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1683" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1683" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-08-15-31-39-1.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-11-08 15.31.39-1" width="640" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1683" class="wp-caption-text">Making friends at the workshop</p></div>
<p>I was surprised at myself. For years I&#8217;d been navigating a slew of cultures, confidently code-switching, getting by and blending in pretty much anywhere with relative ease and advantage. Dual citizen, trilingual, well-traveled, ethnically ambiguous, international education professional, American-German-Jewish-Algerian mutt. I&#8217;d always felt <em>just different enough</em>, rather than <em>too different</em>. I&#8217;m a pretty ruthless cherry-picker, highlighting a particular part of my background when it suits the moment. <em>My dad&#8217;s Jewish and I went on Birthright</em>, I declare to Israeli airport security. <em>My mom&#8217;s German and I&#8217;m a dual citizen,</em> I respond when asked why I live in Berlin. <em>I&#8217;m part Algerian</em>, I say proudly to a cute Arab-German on a date. <em>I also grew up with two languages and have trouble with German</em>, I share with the Vietnamese girls I tutor. I&#8217;d positioned my international identity as the centerpiece of my life a long time ago, letting it guide me both personally and professionally. Perhaps it&#8217;s self-serving or even greedy, but it&#8217;s always felt like my choice.</p>
<p>Others have their choice ripped from them with one ostensibly innocent question: &#8220;<strong>But where are you from from?&#8221; </strong><em><strong>Wo kommst du wirklich her? </strong></em>Translation: &#8220;You must come from somewhere other than here, because you look/sound/pray/move/eat/celebrate differently than <em>we</em> do.&#8221; The plight of the &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWynJkN5HbQ">perpetual foreigner</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>During my past two years in Berlin I&#8217;d started to get a little taste of what that felt like, an after-taste really. <em>No, I&#8217;m not Spanish</em>, I find myself saying at least once a week to those who wonder out-loud or even just start speaking to me in Spanish. I get it, there are an increasing number of Spaniards in Berlin (and Germany). I get it, I have darker features. But whereas I would normally enjoy talking about my background, I now find myself getting irritated and defensive having to explain myself against a recurrent assumption.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;People always ask how my German is so good. I tell them I&#8217;ll try to speak worse German from now on,&#8221; a Vietnamese immigrant says ironically in his studio.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I know people expect me to be a certain way, or have ideas about what type of person I am, of what I&#8217;m capable of, based on how I look,&#8221; a young Eritrean girl ponders at the window.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really Turkish, and I&#8217;m not really German. I identify as a Turkish-German, which is something else,&#8221; reflects a woman from her apartment.<br />
</em></p>
<p>[paraphrased quotes from the &#8220;with WINGS and ROOTS&#8221; documentary]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/withwingsandroots_reimaginebelonging_website_small.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1709" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/withwingsandroots_reimaginebelonging_website_small.png?w=640" alt="withWINGSandROOTS_reimagineBelonging_website_small" width="640" height="344" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/withwingsandroots_reimaginebelonging_website_small.png 720w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/withwingsandroots_reimaginebelonging_website_small-300x161.png 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/withwingsandroots_reimaginebelonging_website_small-650x349.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p>While the woman with the sweaty hands was perhaps frustrated by the selection of adjectives on the list, I realized I was worked up about why there had to be a list at all. For the first time in two years in Berlin, I not only wondered, but cared, whether the others in the room considered me German. Or even German enough.</p>
<p><em>I grew up with German culture, speak the language, have the passport, and now live here</em>, I finally summoned up the courage and coherence to say. <em>But I&#8217;m only one fourth German &#8220;ethnically&#8221;. I know people back in the US who have more German blood than I but have no connection to the country, language, people, history. I don&#8217;t fit everything on that list, but neither do any of you.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Identity is a social construction, I wanted to go on. A fluid and on-going process on both the individual and national level. Increased levels of migration and diversity often spark an instinct to distinguish, retreat, and protect- on both the &#8220;native&#8221; and &#8220;(im)migrant&#8221; sides. But it&#8217;s also an opportunity to reflect, learn, and reinvent. By the end of the workshop, we were getting there.</p>
<p><em>What is your vision for a modern perception of &#8220;Germanness&#8221;?</em> the facilitator prompted us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being open. Intercultural understanding from authorities. Focusing on plurality. Promoting language proficiency. Fostering awareness. Accepting (not only tolerating) others. Self-reflection.&#8221;</p>
<p>A list of adjectives can only put us into a box. A list of actions lets us move forward.</p>
<p>&#8211; <em>By <strong>Sophia Burton</strong></em></p>
<p><em>How serendipitous: a fantastic article on the same topic just came out in Spiegel. Read <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/essay-on-racism-growing-up-turkish-in-germany-a-932154.html">here</a> about one woman&#8217;s reality of growing up as a third-generation Turkish-German in Hamburg and being asked about everything from circumcision, staying out late, and being a &#8220;different Turk&#8221;. </em></p>
<p><em>The documentary clip we watched is from &#8220;with WINGS and ROOTS&#8221; that juxtaposes the realities of (im)migrant life, national identity, and belonging in Berlin and New York City. You can watch the trailer <a href="http://www.withwingsandroots.com/video/trailer">here</a> and <strong>support the project <a href="http://www.withwingsandroots.com/get-involved/donate">here</a></strong><strong>.</strong> According to representatives from the film at the workshop there will be new ways of getting involved in January, so stay tuned! </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul gives Berlin its baseline. In kind, Berlin is richly integrated into the complexity of Istanbul. For no relationship is ever purely one-sided. And so a Berlin : Istanbul connection, which moves beyond <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/music-germany-migrant-workers-compilation"><em>Gastarbeiter </em>music</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0015359/">Fatih Akin films</a>, is what one can find after six days immersed in the shapes and silhouettes of this city of 13 million.</p>
<div id="attachment_1654" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photogram-20131024120809.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1654" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1654" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photogram-20131024120809.jpg" alt="Photogram-20131024120809" width="620" height="620" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photogram-20131024120809.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photogram-20131024120809-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1654" class="wp-caption-text">Europe meets Asia</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dw.de/turkish-guest-workers-transformed-german-society/a-15489210">guest-worker program between Turkey and Germany</a> is often cited as the beginning of a long-standing socio-cultural and economic relationship, though such ties <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/a-short-history-of-turkish-berlin/">got their start long before</a> the post-war boom period of the 1960s. The &#8216;Turkish factor&#8217;, regardless of how it came to be, makes Berlin, and Germany for that matter, the place we know. Without it, students would miss their late night meaty snack in the likes of Döner, the skyline would miss many of its stunning minarets, and the census would be sorely missing the strength of difference (just to name a few).</p>
<p>But being Turkish, German-Turkish, or Turkish-German in Berlin are states of being <a title="Over and Over" href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/">without a formula</a>. In other words, there is <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/a-short-history-of-turkish-berlin/">more to the Turkish factor than just culinary contributions</a> and street-side renditions of &#8220;<em>walla</em>&#8221; taking place on German soil. There is, in fact, also a &#8216;German factor&#8217; abroad.</p>
<p>Traveling to Istanbul opens up the possibility for a more two-sided conversation, where the German traveler can encounter home and the foreign at the same time, in a place familiar but distant in its urban position. And that is just what we (me and my German companion, Juri) did just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1 in Istanbul: Stammtisch</strong></p>
<p>Upon our arrival into Istanbul&#8217;s (proudly named) Ataturk airport, we were led like lost sheep into the belly of a beast, i.e. Turkey&#8217;s passport control. All around us the air buzzed in German, repeating the ritual of my everyday commute on the metro, this time with the confusion and frustration of a forced queue in a city far away from German-land. A mustached man holding a sign for <em>Studenten der Humboldt Universität</em> (students of Berlin&#8217;s Humboldt University) stood on the other side of the human barrier, shifting his weight methodically. Entering behind us would certainly be this year&#8217;s study trip from <a href="http://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/studiengaenge/masowi/getma">Humboldt University&#8217;s Turkish German Master&#8217;s program</a> in the social sciences, which sends Berliners to Ankara and Istanbul every year.</p>
<p>As we wandered into one bookshop after another on our first evening, it seemed that not only visiting German students would be speaking the language of <em>Sauerbraten</em> and Goethe<i>.</i> Residents of Istanbul are learning <em>Almanca </em>(German), maybe now more than ever.</p>
<div style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_almanca.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" " src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_almanca.jpg" alt="Istanbul_Almanca" width="496" height="496" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">advertisements for German language learning in a bookshop</p></div>
<p><strong>Day 2 in Istanbul: Book Swap</strong></p>
<p>Juri and I stumbled upon a German bookstore on an afternoon of gray and drizzle, just off the pedestrian-friendly thoroughfare of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/14/world/europe/taksim-scenes.html?_r=0">Taksim</a>. Within seconds of walking through quaint double doors, we could hear &#8211; once again &#8211; the language of my daily commute. A young German woman chatted enthusiastically with her father, a yellow Reclam paperback of some German classic in her hand. Her father peered over his narrow reading glasses, raising his eyes just to hit the inventory at the back of the store &#8211; stacks of imported magazines and newspapers, including the kitschy tabloids older women with orange hair read at the bus stops in Berlin.</p>
<p>I wandered to the western edge of the dimly lit shop, discovering 20 ft. high shelves of children&#8217;s books in German. Perhaps kids in Istanbul will also grow up reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippi_Longstocking"><em>Pippi Langstrumpf.</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Day 3 in Istanbul: Sharing the Lunch Box</strong></p>
<p>The Germans take their bread seriously, carefully kneading in all kinds of goodies the average American baker might omit out of concern for dental integrity. The so-called Turkish bread one can purchase in Berlin, from <em>Dönerbrot</em> to <em>Milchbrot</em>, has no fit-for-a-squirrel seeds to offer. Enter <em>Vollkornbrot &#8211; </em>your triple whole grain bread &#8211; to be found in your average Istanbul super market. For all the yoga-bending heath nuts in Berlin: this bread is manufactured in Turkey, though ingredients on the package are also translated into German.</p>
<p>And the bread fun doesn&#8217;t stop here. Even the Döner in Istanbul is served in a bun much robuster than Berlin&#8217;s &#8216;Turkish&#8217; prototype.</p>
<div id="attachment_1648" style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_bread.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1648" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1648" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_bread.jpg" alt="Istanbul_bread" width="496" height="496" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_bread.jpg 620w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_bread-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1648" class="wp-caption-text">just your everyday super market</p></div>
<p><strong>Day 4 in Istanbul: The Döner Stories</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The picture of this Döner? No, it wasn&#8217;t taken in Berlin. This dripping lance of assorted protein can be found on the lively streets of Istanbul, where Döner kiosks are visited with as much enthusiasm as in Berlin (so it appeared). There are slight differences in the composition of the sandwich, or shall we say differences in Döner before it became <em>Döner Kebap</em> in Berlin. As the rumor goes, <em>Döner Kebap</em> was invented by a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/4295701/The-man-who-invented-the-doner-kebab-has-died.html">Turkish-German named Mahmut</a>, who happened to serve the traditional vertical meat in a triangular cut of flat bread, instead of in more pita-like Istanbul fashion. The reason, as stated in this same rumor: more bread, so that drunken Berliners might stumble home with saucy meats intact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thirty some years later in Istanbul, meat on a spit can now be received with french fries and fried veggies in that bread package. Berliner style.</p>
<div style="width: 568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_dc3b6ner.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_dc3b6ner.jpg" alt="Istanbul_Döner" width="558" height="558" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">is it lamb? chicken? beef? everything? it&#8217;s Döner.</p></div>
<p><strong>Day 5 in Istanbul: Gimme Some Cake with that Coffee</strong></p>
<p>The German concept of <em>Kaffee und Kuchen</em> (coffee and cake), which inspires the strip of torte-laden cafes in my neighborhood, has made its way to Istanbul in a rich way. Istanbul has its fair share of home-grown sweets, the most delicious ones in fact, involving large amounts of crude honey and nut-laced syrups. Yet, cake with layers of unsweetened cream and a buttery crust, a small apple tart without cinnamon, or a cream-puff styled torte reminds me of my Sunday afternoons devouring Berlin&#8217;s <em>Kuchen</em> culture with friends. And this in the city of the best Baklava I have ever put in my mouth.</p>
<p>In Istanbul&#8217;s trendy harbor-side district, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/mar/22/istanbul-karakoy-top-10-cafes-shops-galleries">Karaköy</a>, we doused ourselves in familiar sugars at a cafe called <a href="http://www.karabatak.com/">Karabatak</a>. A locale where locals in tweed jackets and horn-rimmed glasses slowly sip syrup-sweetened black coffee from delicate (read tiny) French presses. The influence of the Viennese coffee genius and founder Julius Meinl saturates the deco. Dressed up like a Freudian coffee salon, tiles lining the walls, jazzy serenades rolling into &#8216;intellectual&#8217; conversations, one could also be in Berlin&#8217;s Prenzlauer Berg. The extensive magazine selection: <em>Der Spiegel</em>, <em>Marie Claire Deutschland</em>, <em>Vogue Deutschland</em>, dispersed among the newest copy of T<em>he New Yorker</em> and Turkish design magazines. A cosmopolitan coffee date full of Berlin swag and Turkish youngsters.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_cafe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/istanbul_cafe.jpg?w=640" alt="Istanbul_cafe" width="512" height="682" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Day 6 in Istanbul:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Repeat cosmopolitan coffee date with Berlin swag and Turkish youngsters. For hours and with many forks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Day 7 in Istanbul: What I Know</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We boarded our plane in the dark and found ourselves again in German-land, surrounded by the lucid colors of night and the strangely familiar. The smells that had once been part of a Berlin immigrant cityscape were, after the return, now an experience tied to a place, constitutive of a tangible and pungent cross-continental connection. Two worlds connect. In fact, they were never separated.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We had only heard one side of the conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8211; <em>By <strong>Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><a href="http://www.dw.de/turkish-guest-workers-transformed-german-society/a-15489210">Approximately 3 million residents or citizens of Germany have Turkish background</a>, meaning either they or their parents were born in Turkey, according to the German system of demographic classification. The Turkish population in Germany intensified with the guest-worker agreement between Turkey and Germany, which allowed for the reunification of families four years following the initial agreement, thereby turning the &#8216;guest-worker&#8217; into an immigrant with, in many cases, children. Today, <a href="http://www.dw.de/turkeys-economic-boom-lures-german-workers/a-16873373">more and more Germans (with or without background) are considering a move to Turkey</a>, learning about Turkey, or learning Turkish, reflecting the true nature of a two-sided relationship. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img_2302.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img_2302.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_2302" width="640" height="425" /></a>It&#8217;s not everyday you&#8217;re on TV, let alone get alluded to as a traitor by a host of public figures, including the Minister of the Treasury, all for being an expat. But both of these things happened to my friend and colleague Moran Yaheli when she was recently profiled in a TV report about Israelis living abroad.</p>
<p><em>We were on 4 episodes, there were 5 in total, and I&#8217;ve been on the morning talk show and the radio, </em>Moran recounts&#8230; <em>and I was told that a satire show used our part from the morning show. This Sunday I&#8217;m going to be on another morning show panel. I&#8217;m a Z-list celebrity!</em></p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll get back to that.</p>
<p>Moran moved to Berlin from Tel Aviv in 2011 after meeting her now fiancé, Bastiaan (Bas). Their story alone is a lesson in 21st century romances: they met on the online Couchsurfing platform, and Moran spent a few nights on Bas&#8217; couch in Amsterdam while traveling around Europe. After surviving a few months of long-distance Skype calls and the occasional visit, the two decided to make a home for themselves in Europe. They both found jobs in Berlin and now live together in the <em>Schöneberg</em> district. Last year they welcomed their first baby, a beautiful boy named Tommy.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1627" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto.jpeg?w=640" alt="Israel part II 081 kl auto" width="640" height="425" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto.jpeg 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto-300x199.jpeg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/israel-part-ii-081-kl-auto-650x431.jpeg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Tommy is primed to grow up as what has been coined the Third Culture Kid (TCK): &#8220;a person who has spent a significant part of his or her developmental years outside their parents’ culture&#8221; (David Pollock). With an Israeli mother, Dutch father, childhood (or at least babyhood) in Germany, and frequent trips to both mother- and fatherlands, Tommy will grow up navigating at least three cultural codes, languages, and geographies. It may seem like an unusual life, but it&#8217;s more and more a norm in our increasingly globalized and interconnected world. Even Buzzfeed published an <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/31-signs-youre-a-third-culture-kid">article</a> on &#8220;signs you&#8217;re a TCK&#8221; that included swearing in multiple languages, time zone expertise, and a transient understanding of &#8220;home&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>Tommy is a child of combined cultures, </em>Moran reflects<em>&#8230; he has both an Israeli and Dutch passport&#8230; but even though he was born in Berlin he can&#8217;t be a German citizen (without giving up the Israeli one). It&#8217;s the same for me, I feel I have more than one &#8220;home&#8221;, and I guess he will have that, too.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1580" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg" alt="285679521_640" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640-300x168.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/285679521_640-310x174.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/41264088">Source</a></p>
<p>With only 8 months behind him so far in this world, Tommy has already taken two lengthy trips to Tel Aviv and one to the Netherlands. He is a dual citizen and hears an average 2-4 languages per day: Hebrew from his mom, Dutch from his dad, German from his environment, and English, the language in which his parents communicate.</p>
<p><em>We want to do the OPOL method, &#8216;One Parent One Language&#8217;, have you heard of it? </em>Moran asks me.<em> That way he gets just Hebrew from me, just Dutch from Bas. Tommy&#8217;s baby noises are kind of both Hebrew and Dutch, he does a lot of the &#8220;Chhh&#8221; noise&#8230; </em>she giggles.<em> When the neighbor babysits he only speaks German with him. I want him to go to a bilingual Hebrew-German Kita </em>(child care center).</p>
<p>Tommy is not just (im)migrant, not just citizen, but somewhere in between. He was born and lives in Berlin but isn&#8217;t a German citizen. If he moves to either Israel or the Netherlands, he will be moving there as a citizen but won&#8217;t necessarily have grown up there. His diverse lineage, cross-cultural upbringing, and even his darker features may mean he carries the mark of <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/04/23/over-and-over/"><em>Migrationshintergrund</em></a> most of his life, whether in Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, or somewhere else. Tommy will &#8220;build relationships to all these cultures but perhaps never have full ownership of any&#8221;. TCKs often feel a stronger sense of belonging and connection to others who have a similar background rather than a particular one. When Tommy grows up, he may fall in love and marry another TCK, someone who grew up in Rome with Singaporean and British parents, or perhaps someone from Sydney with French and Brazilian parents. Studies say his chances of doing so are <a href="http://www.denizenmag.com/2011/09/infographic-the-modern-third-culture-kid/">1 in 4</a>. His future inclination to raise his children as TCKs? <a href="http://www.denizenmag.com/2011/09/infographic-the-modern-third-culture-kid/">Even higher</a>. His sense of home will be an abstract one, one that he feels more in relation to people, memories, and experiences than citizenship, borders, and geography.</p>
<p><em>I can&#8217;t vote in Israel because Israeli doesn&#8217;t allow absentee ballots&#8230; even my cousin </em>(in Israel)<em> doesn&#8217;t think I should be able to vote in their elections because I don&#8217;t live there, </em>Moran rolls her eyes.<em> But even though I don&#8217;t live in Israel, I still feel it&#8217;s my home&#8230; my friends and family are there. As for Tommy, he will have 3 homes for now and as he grows maybe just two- Israel which he will visit a lot, and Holland where he will likely live at some point. If we&#8217;re in Holland or Germany, I&#8217;m going to be seen as a foreigner. I don&#8217;t want Tommy to be made fun of or be ashamed of me. So it&#8217;s important for me that Tommy meets and grows up in an international environment, with kids who also have diverse backgrounds. With other kids like him.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-08-16-38-33.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-08-16-38-33.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-10-08 16.38.33" width="512" height="682" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Confusions and complications aside, studies on Third Culture Kids show that they reap a whole host of benefits from their intercultural upbringings and lifestyles: TCKs live in four countries during their lives on average, 85% speak two or more languages (47% speak three or more), and 90% earn a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree with 40% going on to further study. Statistically they&#8217;re a well-educated, well-rounded, and well-suited group for the demands of the 21st century, both professionally and personally. They just may have difficulty articulating to you <a href="http://vimeo.com/41264088">where home is</a>.</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t know where Tommy will end up, </em>considers Moran.<em> Right now the current situation in Israel is complicated and I can&#8217;t see us going back. Economically, politically, demographically, religiously, etc. But I am not giving up hope&#8230; Israel is a beautiful place, the best place, it&#8217;s just unfortunately in crisis. If things get better I would be on the first plane home. And, if the situation improves, I would love for Tommy to choose Israel, too.  </em></p>
<p>As to the economic situation&#8230;</p>
<p><em>The rising number of Orthodox Jews is scary and it is so expensive to live in Tel Aviv. I paid the same rent for a shoebox in Tel Aviv as I do now with Bas in our big, new flat in Berlin. Groceries are over twice as expensive in Israel than Germany!</em></p>
<p>126% more expensive in fact, which brings us back to the TV report. Grocery and rent costs were one topic Moran and a series of other Israeli expats were asked about when interviewed about living abroad. The economic situation in Israel is pretty dire and gave rise to the ongoing social justice protests that began in 2011, the largest in the country&#8217;s history with over 1 million people gathering in Tel Aviv&#8217;s Rabin Square. While mostly focused on the cost of living differences, Moran also got token questions about what it feels like to be a Jew in Germany. On the show, the journalist shuttles her over to the Holocaust Memorial to the Jews in <em>Mitte</em>. He&#8217;s curious how she feels when she sees it.</p>
<p><em>The Jewish Memorial doesn&#8217;t speak to me,</em> Moran explained first to the journalist and later to me. <em>It&#8217;s more the everyday. Like seeing trains covered in snow&#8230; we don&#8217;t have snow covered trains in Israel and it reminds me of images we saw in school of the deportation of the Jews. Or hearing the voice on the train say &#8216;</em>Ausstieg&#8217;<em> which always makes me think of &#8216;Auschwitz&#8217;. Seeing old people on the street and wondering what role they played in World War II.</em></p>
<p>And the Minister of the Treasury? When asked to respond to the TV report, he was in Budapest, giving a speech on antisemitism.</p>
<p><em>A word to all those who have &#8220;had it&#8221; and left for Europe&#8230; </em>Moran translates his response for me&#8230;<em> I&#8217;m here to deliver a speech in the Budapest Parliament about antisemitism, to remind them of how they tried to kill my father here only because Jewish people didn&#8217;t have their own land, how they did kill my grandfather in a camp, how they starved my uncles, how my grandmother was rescued at the last second from a &#8220;death march&#8221;. So excuse me if I&#8217;m a bit impatient with people who are willing to throw away the only homeland the Jewish people have ever had, just because Berlin is &#8220;more convenient&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Other politicians and one of the country&#8217;s most famous lawyers went so far as to call the Israeli expats in Berlin &#8220;traitors&#8221; and &#8220;slime that crawls in the sewer of Jewish society&#8221;, respectively. On the whole, however, Moran reports positive responses and understanding from those back in Israel, something she claims is a shift from the Zionist past.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s the older generation that has a problem with people leaving Israel&#8230; the ones who escaped antisemitism, built the country and died in wars to protect it, </em>Moran explains. <em>They see our leaving as abandoning the ship, the cause, the ideal&#8230; for money. My parents were born in Israel but my grandparents were from Europe, so I have two passports, too, </em><em>Israeli and Romanian. </em><em>I want Tommy to grow up with both tradition and choice&#8230; for his religion and for where he makes his home. </em></p>
<p>And choices he will have&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-18.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1483" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-18.jpg" alt="photo-18" width="505" height="505" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-18.jpg 640w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-18-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it was the 1st grade. We were drawing pictures of our families and I carefully wrote <em>Mami</em> under the lopsided stick figure cast as my mother. A kid next to me leaned over and inspected my work. &#8220;That&#8217;s not how you write &#8216;Mommy&#8217;!&#8221; he squealed. &#8220;Yes it is!&#8221; I responded fiercely, confident that this was exactly how my <em>Mami</em> had taught me to spell it. Our teacher overheard the bickering and swooped in for the rescue. We were both right, she explained patiently. <em>Mami</em> was just &#8220;Mommy&#8221; in a different language.</p>
<p>That was the first time I can remember realizing that something about me was &#8220;different&#8221;. That I grew up with two languages, one of which was different than English. That I had more than one home, one of which was different than that of my classmates.</p>
<p>Growing up, I didn&#8217;t need a plane to travel from one home to another. There was my outside home, with school and friends and TGIF and snap bracelets and Rice Krispie Treats and all-you-can-eat buffets and pop culture references that I (mostly) understood. Then there was my inside home, where my mom confused the word &#8220;crush&#8221; with &#8220;crash&#8221;, we were told to put spit on our bug bites, summers were spent with my German grandparents instead of at camp, and Nutella was always king over peanut butter &amp; jelly. That&#8217;s the thing about transnationalism: It wasn&#8217;t just geography that marked the borders of my two homes. It was the words, the scents, the movements, and most of all, the people.</p>
<p><em>Transnationals are distinguished from migrants and immigrants because they are rooted in more than one country and culture. They are not simply &#8220;migrants&#8221; because they are categorized by more than temporary movement. They settle and become invested in the political, economical, and cultural patterns of their &#8220;host country&#8221;. But they are not simply &#8220;immigrants&#8221; either, because their movement is not primarily one-directional: they remain engaged elsewhere, maintaining connections, contributing to their &#8220;home&#8221; society, sending remittances (money), participating politically, etc.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-2.jpg" alt="photo 2" width="517" height="517" /></a></p>
<p>Of course there was the occasional collision of my homes. Usually they were trivial, like when I was gawked at in the middle school cafeteria for pulling <em>pâté</em> and baguette out of my lunchbox (à la &#8220;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&#8221;) or when I had to leave Friday school dances early because of Saturday German school. But sometimes they were bigger, like the handful of times I was called a &#8220;Nazi&#8221; or &#8220;German-Jewish-American-Princess&#8221; by classmates and when our parents decided to pull us out of high school and move to Germany for half a year.</p>
<p>Overall though, straddling my two homes was and remains relatively easy because my &#8220;differences&#8221; came across as interesting at best and weird at worst. They almost never held me back. Unlike many other children with immigrant backgrounds, I wasn&#8217;t so much switching between non-dominant and dominant culture as I was dominant-foreign (European) to dominant (upper-middle class white American). I didn&#8217;t struggle with English at school, my parents had no trouble helping me with my homework, and no one looked down on me for eating with fork in left hand and knife in right (except maybe when it was pizza).</p>
<p><em>Transnationals can also be identified as &#8220;cultural straddlers&#8221; who navigate life between multiple worlds. Anthropologists and sociologists call it &#8220;code-switching&#8221;, meaning their language, behavior, and mannerisms shift within different social contexts, depending on what is appropriate at what time and with which people (similarly to the way one acts differently at a job interview than at home with friends). Groups within the same nationality can also code-switch between different cultural identities that, based on historical and structural forces, have contributed to distinguished speech, capital, personal tastes, etc. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo 1" width="581" height="581" /></a></p>
<p>Now 28 years old and living &#8220;abroad&#8221; the past two years, I still navigate between my various identities with relative ease but my transnationalism has become markedly more pronounced. I switch regularly and fluently between two passports, two languages, even two sides of my wallet. With time, I find myself switching more seamlessly between health care systems, political processes, and workplace cultures.</p>
<p>But now an ocean more clearly demarcates my two homes and, no matter which side I&#8217;m on, keeps me away from people I care deeply about. That is the switch I find most difficult.</p>
<p>When I step into a plane heading east or west over the Atlantic, my mind begins to shift and retrieve minute details stored in the back of my mind. <em>Does the hairdresser also get a 20% tip?&#8230;</em> <em>Ach ja, store&#8217;s closed on Sundays, make sure to grab food tonight&#8230; Don&#8217;t forget to take your driver&#8217;s license when you go out, they&#8217;ll probably card you&#8230; German passport at EU control, American at immigration&#8230; </em>But deeper within me is a greater shift that pushes and pulls, twists and turns, fuels me with excitement and longing and sometimes sadness. It doesn&#8217;t present itself in clear or rational thoughts. It&#8217;s just present.</p>
<p>A week ago I sat in the plane, about to land in Washington D.C. for the first time in almost 10 months, staring down at my U.S. customs form. I had scribbled in my passport and flight numbers, the itemized list of chocolates and coffee I was carting over and their approximate value, thinking as usual about how all the Europeans in the plane were just expected to speak English and fill out the same form. Language obviously wasn&#8217;t my problem, but I was stuck nonetheless:</p>
<p><em>Please check one box: Visitor or Resident</em></p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t they get it? I&#8217;m always going away, and I&#8217;m always coming home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The age of migration is upon us. Human beings are mobile, in part due to the wonder of air travel, whose planes make relationship and imagination possible in spite of vast distances.</p>
<p>What social scientists deem a phenomenon, I call my lived reality. I collect toiletries in Ziploc baggies (an import) ready and loaded for the trips ‘home’ – a term, which we all know is ever ambiguous and relative. I transport chocolates and schnaps to loved ones on the other side, bringing back Trader Joe&#8217;s peanut butter and Pinot Noir to this side. I am heavily invested in both.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1459" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope.jpg?w=640" alt="window_collidoscope" width="512" height="682" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope.jpg 488w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope-225x300.jpg 225w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/window_collidoscope-487x650.jpg 487w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<p>It might be confusing, but this dynamic – this swinging pendulum of belonging and longing through distance that depends on where you find yourself – is both challenging and beautiful. Out of this experience, we learn about the true weight of relationship beyond the convenience of proximity.</p>
<p>For going is about leaving, but it doesn’t have to be defined by it.</p>
<p><i>Berlin Tegel is quiet in the mornings, the terminals kept so tidy to hide even the most dramatic of goodbyes. It is 4am, and I am heading to Portland, Oregon via Amsterdam. Looking around, I am reminded of my first arrival back in 2010 with a plan only to study but no plan for where I would live, who would be my social support, or even how I should dress to avoid the look of the foreign (something now worth embracing). I stayed with the family of a girl I had met on the plane, whose father happened to be the chief of the Kreuzberg fire department, giving me my first introductory automotive tour in nothing other than a red fire engine. Now, cloaked in pre-dawn darkness, I lean into the arms of my biggest fan, saying goodbye in a language different from the one that will soon fill my mouth with memory, with a brevity different than that felt when pressed into the family members and friends I am to visit but cannot take with me.</i></p>
<p>Love, belonging, and connection do not dissipate in the process of journey or the reality of separation, neither are such feelings interchangeable depending on location. These feelings remain differentiated.</p>
<p>Because the comings and goings of life in transit are made material not purely by the wonder of air travel and the spaces which mediate it but by the destinations and origins on either side. Anthropologists emphasize the role of imagination and memory in unraveling and redrawing the lines and sensations of locations to which we feel connected. Put simply, we carry around images of &#8216;home&#8217;, &#8216;paradise&#8217;, &#8216;university&#8217;, &#8216;work&#8217;, &#8216;grandma’s&#8217; etc. with us, often in multiple representations, often in ever-changing quantities and with ever-changing qualities. Pink glasses with pineapple skewers, dreary winters full of long conversations near the sea. Umbrellas and the smell of moist newspapers, packed metro cars and cake-filled coffee dates. A stuffy airport with the smell of cigarettes and burnt espresso, a stuffy airport with the smell of mold and soy milk.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1436" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467.png?w=640" alt="Aviary Photo_130238137593380467" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467.png 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467-300x225.png 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467-650x487.png 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137593380467-80x60.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><i>I</i><i> look at my luggage, marked with a name, a number, a house &#8211; somewhere that could very well be irrelevant to where I am going. In my mind, a feeling of moving, passing, changing – a sense of going. The airport cannot begin to represent this moment, one that has become central to my daily life, to the shape and activity of my social networks, even shaping my consumer decisions and the ways in which I do not invest in sets of towels or dishware. Even with the distraction of thought, I put my passport into the check-in machine, automatically flipping through the questions I have been asked on this same monitor now for the fourth time in two years. &#8220;What is my nationality?&#8221; &#8220;What is my country of residence?&#8221;, the differences here are key to the international system but not to mine. The German woman next to me enters the U.S. as &#8220;country of residence&#8221;, thinking that her trip to the United States validates her residency. I correct it in the computer for her, in order to speed up the line, though I wish to add that well&#8230;residency is complicated.</i></p>
<p>Airports might just be the perfect splice of how we navigate relationship. Position yourself for an hour on the curbside of Arrivals and you will see what I mean: airports are special for the human condition. We find ourselves gathered in establishments organizing such massive scales of movement, suspended in air, hurled gently across the ocean into the arms of those we love and those who love us. In hours, our imaginations and our longings are realized. As a result, we are inevitably pulled out of the arms of love, support, and belonging on one side, deferring to the other.</p>
<p><i>After a tight squeeze, the face that I always want to see turns to walk away. I am filled with emotion, a feeling I know I will have in just two weeks on my way of return – hugging my family goodbye and being overcome by their absence in seconds, by the weight of leaving, now for a second time in less than a month. Excitement and possibility tainted by a strange loneliness and fear. I look back to find his hand waving. Will his fingers be the same in 16 days, his voice? Will my father’s face have aged? My mother’s mind? I turn toward the security line, into the place I am going. Umbrellas and the smell of moist newspapers, dreary winters full of long conversations near the sea. </i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238137800398147.png" alt="Aviary Photo_130238137800398147" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Going is a process of letting go (of my slight fear of flying, of my need to be ‘on call’, of my need to validate my relationships by constant contact). It involves packing – knowing I will return or want to bring back with me all kinds of transnational goodies and identity markers, like <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/Pubs">McMenamins</a> coasters. But more than anything, it is about coming into my imagination of this other home and preparing for what will be the task of leaving it.</p>
<p>As an hour in an airport would demonstrate, we migrate, we immigrate, we travel and tour, and thus, we leave someone and something behind. When we return, it is always with change: hairs lost on the other side of the ocean, water in the gut from different ground, dreams focused on the precipice of their mountains. Yet, relationships continue, reliant on a process of adaptation and connection that is not co-dependent on texting or casual coffee dates. And we are better for it.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1439" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318.png?w=640" alt="Aviary Photo_130238143157649318" width="640" height="384" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318.png 768w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318-300x180.png 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/aviary-photo_130238143157649318-650x390.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>As a voluntary immigrant to a place in which my sense of belonging and connection has been entirely invented, I have learned this much: going is about letting go and embracing that, in the face of distance, our connections to each other are going to be ok.</p>
