										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Berlin&#8217;s &#8220;problem district&#8221; to <a href="http://www.bz-berlin.de/aktuell/berlin/kreuzberg-teurer-als-charlottenburg-article1398469.html">more expensive</a> than <em>spießig</em> Charlottenburg: Kreuzberg&#8217;s made quite the transformation over the decades, but migration continues to shape its identity and reputation as a district.</p>
<p>The bulk of Kreuzberg&#8217;s diversity stems from the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s, when guest workers were recruited by West Germany to fill labor shortages after World War II*. Kreuzberg&#8217;s dilapidated housing became home to guest workers, primarily from Turkey. The district soon came to be known as &#8220;Little Istanbul&#8221;. In 2014 you would still be hard pressed to find a block without a <em>Döner</em> <em>Kebab </em>stand or five, but the <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/08/07/ramadan-with-neighbors-its-about-showing-up/">district&#8217;s diversity</a> extends far past Anatolia.</p>
<p>Along with districts like Neukölln and Wedding, Kreuzberg is renowned for its <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/05/11/happy-weekend-its-not-about-integration-or-isnt-it/">immigrant integration</a> challenges that include low educational attainment and poor German language skills, high unemployment rates, crime and drug abuse, and gentrification. At the same time, the area has become increasingly attractive to <a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/2013/09/06/multiculturalism-diversity-and-the-big-city/">students</a>, hip expats, and young families. The result is a veritable array of nationalities, cuisines, houses of worship, and attires, as vivid as the graffiti gracing the walls of its gray housing and slender canals.</p>
<p>There are many popular spots in Kreuzberg, but the Maybachufer canal is perhaps one that most poignantly displays the cultural fusion that makes Kreuzberg a very special place to call home.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swans.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swans.jpg" alt="swans" width="594" height="594" /></a></p>
<p><strong>An Ode to the Maybachufer</strong></p>
<p>If I go away, I&#8217;ll remember the swans. And the walls of graffiti they floated along.</p>
<p>Rows of satellite dishes, speckled across gray concrete. Lingerers outside Kaiser&#8217;s, empty bottles at their feet.</p>
<p>Men huddled over pear-shaped glasses of Çay. Girls in tiny shorts and tights, snags in their thighs.</p>
<p>A market with only two rows, but infinite choice. Vendors calling &#8220;lecka! lecka!&#8221;, hints of somewhere else in their voice.</p>
<p>Hair smothered by scarves or impossibly fake dye. Individuals by words: &#8220;expat&#8221;, &#8220;immigrant&#8221;. You or I.</p>
<p>Where &#8220;German&#8221; ends and &#8220;other&#8221; begins, we futilely try to decide.</p>
<p>But the swans. They just keep floating by.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Sophia Burton</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The Maybachufer Turkish Market (U1-Kottbusser Tor or U8-Schoenleinstrasse) runs on Tuesdays and Fridays from approximately 12pm-6pm. Go for the cheap produce and spinach-cheese <em>Gözleme. </em><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-15-15-09-14.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-892 aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-15-15-09-14.jpg" alt="2013-06-15 15.09.14" width="640" height="480" /></a>A Berlin restaurant with an American name run by a Tunisian who prepares Italian fare in Halal style? Anywhere else this collision of cultures on a plate would be considered poor marketing.  In Neukölln it&#8217;s more or less the norm.</p>
<p>&#8220;L.A. New York Restaurant&#8221; was the second stop along <em>Erkundung im Paradies, </em>one of numerous tours offered by <a href="http://route44-neukoelln.de/touren/paradies_tour1.html">Route 44</a> that explore Neukölln&#8217;s migration history and interculturalism. The tours are entirely female-run and designed by a group of diverse women who are proud to call Neukölln their &#8220;(second) home&#8221;.</p>
<p>Neukölln is Berlin&#8217;s 8th district and home to 320,000 residents, approximately 40% of which are not ethnically German. Almost 150 nationalities are represented (primarily Turkey, the Arab world, and former Yugoslavia) and the district is at the heart of Berlin&#8217;s gentrification debate, making Neukölln hard to ignore. Nonetheless, it was off my radar for years and continues to be for tourists who either don&#8217;t know it exists or have been warned it&#8217;s too dangerous to visit. My 250 page Berlin guide book from 2003 doesn&#8217;t say one word about Neukölln. Ten years later and it&#8217;s still not mentioned on <a href="http://www.timeout.com/berlin/features/10/berlin-area-guide">this list</a> or <a href="http://www.fodors.com/news/understanding-berlins-neighborhoods-5831.html">this list</a> or <a href="http://www.cityscouter.com/travelguides/berlin/Berlin-Districts.html">this list</a>. It is on <a href="http://berlin.cityseekr.com/cityguide/district-guide-1">this one</a>: &#8220;More down-to-earth are the working-class districts of Wedding in the north and Neukölln in the south, which is sometimes referred to as the Berlin Bronx. Although they both have a reputation of being ghettos for the poor, unemployed and other down-and-outs, they are not as bad as they are made out to be.&#8221; What a ringing endorsement.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>The Route 44 girls describe Neukölln as a region of &#8220;irritating problems but fascinating potential&#8221;. Unfortunately Neukölln&#8217;s problems go beyond irritating to downright serious: they have one of the city&#8217;s highest unemployment rates (<a href="http://www.berlin.de/ba-neukoelln/derbezirk/arbeitslose.html">17%</a>), high child poverty rates, and a crime rate that is about 40% higher than Berlin&#8217;s average. But it is also home to immense diversity, creativity, and rich cultural history. Reducing Neukölln (or any struggling region) to the &#8220;poor, unemployed and other down-and-outs&#8221; is not only unfair, it&#8217;s unproductive.</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-15-15-44-50.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-15-15-44-50.jpg" alt="2013-06-15 15.44.50" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Erkundung im Paradies</em> or &#8220;Exploring Paradise&#8221; showcases this &#8220;fascinating potential&#8221; through an exploration of a neighborhood and its various houses of worship, educational institutions, trendy bars, and international restaurants. Yet perhaps the most interesting facet of the tour was not the stops itself, but the open dialogue it generated. The tour participants were largely locals and the intermittent chatter and questions culminated in a discussion on religion and the role of the headscarf. Hiba and Maria, our guides, responded openly and respectfully to questions from the group that ranged from  &#8220;Aren&#8217;t women forced to wear them?&#8221; to &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wear one?&#8221; Hiba (Lebanese-German) and Maria (Pakistani-German) don&#8217;t wear headscarves and explained that while it&#8217;s a commitment they&#8217;re not ready to make now, they don&#8217;t rule it out for the future. Either way, it&#8217;s their choice alone.</p>
<p>When asked by a  journalist why they do the tours, they responded quite simply: &#8220;Neukölln has a bad reputation, and we want to change that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the guidebooks should take note, but I&#8217;m not sure we need them. These women are creating their own and it&#8217;s a lot more interesting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an immigrant of a certain type, one often converses with, discusses, and reads about other so-called ex-patriots. It&#8217;s easy to feel like the world revolves around you, which must be why it&#8217;s easy to assume that we &#8211; the largely English-speaking, often temporary immigrants &#8211; are at the heart of the gentrification debate in Berlin. There&#8217;s no shortage of talk about how we don&#8217;t (or won&#8217;t) learn German, how we move into traditionally poorer neighborhoods and contribute to rising rent costs, and how we waltz into the corner cafe demanding a fancy latte rather than a good ol&#8217; Milchkaffee.</p>
<p>But what I had forgotten about were <strong>the rich and educated Germans &#8211; the <em>Schwaben</em>, for that matter, </strong>migrants from Southern Germany charged with gentrifying Berlin, essentially the root of the careless economic change sweeping the city. <em>Schwaben </em>have begun to <strong>represent a German crisis of identity, one acted out between markets and their effects on long-standing communities</strong>. Emblematic of this crisis is the &#8216;vandalism&#8217; of the statues of one famous <em>Schwaben</em> splattered with <em>Currywurst</em> (the iconic dish of Berlin) and one famous <em>Berlinerin</em> splattered with <em>Spätzle</em> (the icon dish of Swabia), as pictured below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3-format36.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-607 alignnone" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3-format36.jpg" alt="3-format36" width="384" height="288" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3-format36.jpg 712w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3-format36-300x225.jpg 300w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3-format36-650x487.jpg 650w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3-format36-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></a><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4-format15.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-615 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4-format15.jpg" alt="4-format15" width="326" height="330" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4-format15.jpg 544w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4-format15-296x300.jpg 296w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" /></a></p>
<p>The ketchup- or cheese-smeared faces of Swabian icons are just one small part of a culture war between imagined identities and exaggerated actors, i.e. the alternative Berliner vs. the fancy-schmancy Swabian. The worst part in this so-called <em>Spätzlekrieg </em>or &#8216;Spätzel war&#8217;  is the escalation from humorous prodding to line-crossing slogans. <strong>Parallels between Nazi persecution of the Jews, particularly in the insignia of <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/kristallnacht/frame.htm"><em>Kristallnacht</em></a>, can be found across the city.</strong> Berlin is a city rife with history; is its memory this short?</p>
<p><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/berliner-spaetzlekrieg-eskaliert_artikelquer.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/berliner-spaetzlekrieg-eskaliert_artikelquer.jpg" alt="Berliner-Spaetzlekrieg-eskaliert_ArtikelQuer" width="404" height="270" /></a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/b3a73-naziterrorindeutschland1933gesch25c325a4ftj25c325bcdisch.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sprayed on storefronts around some of Berlin&#8217;s gentrifying neighborhoods are the words <em>Kauf nicht bei Schwab&#8217;n</em>, Don&#8217;t buy from Schwaben, a direct usage of the tags in the period of escalation before German deportation of its Jewish population, as pictured in this image above from <em>Kristallnacht</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/article115879959/Wowereit-verurteilt-Schwabenhass-in-Berlin.html"><em>Schwabenhass</em></a>, hatred of <em>Schwaben</em>, may be a problem of discrimination and unjust intimidation, but it is not necessarily as extreme as this graffiti demonstrates. Like the Neo-Nazi presence in Berlin, it is hopefully a minority of enraged individuals sending such messages, not ordinary Berliners participating so overtly in a culture war run on Nazi taglines. Yet, as Germany&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/18/how-german-neo-nazis-evaded-police">scandal of right-wing terror</a> unfolds in court for the world to see, even a little bit of rage and misplaced language should be taken seriously and cautiously. <strong>Language and the explanations it provides for socioeconomic change can be as powerful as policy in determining public opinion. </strong>In the efforts of understanding and taming this condiment-covered beast of a crisis between Berlin and the incoming <em>Schwaben</em>, let us deconstruct a bit.</p>
<p>Hatred does not come out of the mist of Neverland, nor do <em>Schwaben</em>. So, who are <em>Schwaben</em> really, why are they now the object of aggressive criticism?</p>
<p><em>Schwaben</em> stem from the imagined community of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabia">Swabia</a> or technically from the state of Baden-Württemberg. Located in Southwestern Germany, this traditionally <em>Schwäbisch</em>-speaking group within Germany has historically stretched as far as Bavaria. <strong>Accuracy of geographic or linguistic boundaries aside, <em>Schwaben</em> in Berlin have come to represent an ideological and historical conflict &#8211; a crisis &#8211; within Germany, one that has become particularly salient and searing since the fall of the wall in 1989.</strong></p>
<p>This period between 1989 and 1990 is what Germans refer to as <em>die</em> <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Wende">Wende</a>, </em>the big change, in which a reunited Germany faced the fusion of a strict socialist economic system with an Americanized capitalist machine, to put it simply and dramatically. Rapidly following the change of power, bananas became available in the East, pickles came in more than one kind of jar, and automobiles came in models that didn&#8217;t just start with the letter &#8220;T&#8221;. The effects of this shift to a market economy in the East, however, were not as rosy as this example of consumerism demonstrates. <strong>High rates of unemployment, closure of factories and schools, dissolution of livelihoods and promised pensions sent ripples through the former East.</strong> For the many of the residents subject to these unanticipated changes, longing for the old days &#8211; a phenomenon nicely called <em>Ostalgie</em> (nostalgia for the East) &#8211; became a prevalent response to the <em>BRD</em>&#8216;s (Federal German Republic) sweeping policies. Contrasts were drawn and enemies were created, <em>Feindbilder</em>, as they say in German: a concept of the enemy.</p>
<p>Representative of much of this change and the trauma and tumult that resulted are the cities of Frankfurt and Stuttgart (one could even throw Munich in, for good measure). Both of these financial capitals in Germany, where men and women in Western business attire can be seen entering America-styled skyscrapers, embody many of these latent <strong>East vs. West differences</strong>. As a product of history, these cities and the residents that stem from them also embody the animosities and frustrations of geographic and ideological division. High-rise glass structures and the minions that occupy them have come to represent a struggle with history and an uncertain present, mow imported via its Swabian personnel to the streets of Berlin.</p>
<p>The tensions between market-induced change and struggling communities are particularly palpable in Berlin, as a  reunited city familiar to hardships and class differences. It is currently the poorest capital relative to its country&#8217;s GDP within the EU, hence Klaus Wowereit&#8217;s tagline <em>Berlin ist arm aber sexy</em>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/7953479">poor but sexy</a>. Despite flashy art openings and fashion shows, there are plenty of <a href="http://www.dw.de/poverty-study-a-further-blow-to-poor-berlin/a-597767-1">residents on welfare</a>, children <a href="http://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Publikationen/Aufsaetze/2011/HZ_201104-08.pdf">struggling to acquire adequate nutrition</a>, and financial debacles like a severely unfinished airport and inadequate educational institutions to paint quite an un-sexy picture.</p>
<p><strong>Berlin isn&#8217;t Frankfurt or Stuttgart with its sparkling streets and mowed lawns, where <em>Schwaben</em> (often inaccurately grouped together) run the show. It is a city struggling to remake itself and accommodate both newcomers, the unwelcome immigrants (<em>Gastarbeiter</em>) of yore, and <em>Urberliner</em> (old time residents), all while keeping its precarious budget afloat.</strong> Problems abound in the process, including the false assignment of priorities, such as a focus on <a href="http://www.megaspree.de/">temporary media projects</a> that provide snaz for short-term residents but do nothing to fix long-term structural problems.  Newcomers with higher incomes and chicer haircuts also contribute to 1. rent increases in a city without a rent floor or ceiling and 2. price increases in everything from theater tickets to bread. Gentrification, the buzzword seeping through the city like the yellow fog through T.S. Eliot&#8217;s &#8220;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&#8221;, draws many rapid and unfair conclusions in response to these problems.</p>
<p>Enter the undesired <em>Schwaben, </em>the Swabian enemy. These <em>Schwaben</em> may in fact distort real estate value,  but no one group can be charged with single-handedly transforming quaint alternative neighborhoods into Stuttgart-look-alikes, let alone Berlin into a money-making machine for the affluent. The problems of uncontrolled markets and post-GDR reconstruction will not fix themselves, nor will they be solved by aggressive prejudice or hatred toward a supposed enemy, created, after all, for the purpose of simply needing one. A little dialogue, historical perspective, and vigilance toward language and actors is in order. Maybe even a conversation with one of these <em>Schwaben.</em></p>
<p>After all, <em>Spätzle</em> is eaten everywhere. Even in Berlin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meet Ali and Zoe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zoeandali.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-456 aligncenter" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zoeandali.jpg" alt="ZoeandAli" width="640" height="960" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zoeandali.jpg 433w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zoeandali-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>You may have heard of them. Zoe takes pictures of Ali while walking down the street and posts them on her tumblr called <a href="http://alioutfit.tumblr.com/">What Ali Wore</a>.</p>
<p>Her project has seen no shortage of attention. A few articles in <a href="http://www.mitteschoen.com/2013/03/25/der-etwas-andere-fashion-blog-what-ali-wore/">local</a> and <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/mediacenter/fotostrecken/berlin/fotoblog-what-ali-wore/8052528.html">national</a> German media, even some pieces by <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/29/living/what-ali-wore-tumblr">CNN</a> and a Turkish daily, and her followers went from 29 to more than 24,000. The trend of street style seems to catch the most attention; his outfits boast the irony of cosmopolitan contrasts: youthful pastels with a grayed moustache, prayer beads and a baseball cap, Kebab and a double-breasted plaid suit. Designers have even offered to send her clothing for Ali, she tells me &#8211; to dress Ali like a mannequin for a show. She declined, of course, she says a bit perturbed.</p>
<p>This is not just a fashion blog glorifying fabrics or cuts. A person and experience &#8211; positioned in the city and its landscape &#8211; exists behind the camera, behind Ali’s swagger. What beauty are we missing if we consider images simply for what they are, a blend of red polyester against a backdrop of hipsterdom? This is about Ali and Zoe and their well-timed collision. And it&#8217;s about gentrification. Most importantly, it&#8217;s about friendship.</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Zoe met Ali last summer while setting up furniture outside the Café where she works on Panierstraße, nestled in the booming heart of the Neukölln district. The scene is rough streets meet Williamsburg ten years ago. And ‘rough’ being the Berlin variety which is, well, mild. Like its American counterpart in Brooklyn, we discuss how the Café where she works and its environs have been the brunt of jokes, even legitimate public attack, as of late.<strong> Affluent expats, usually English-speaking, move in to transform the neighborhood with their record stores and crumpet Cafés, so goes the rhetoric, destroying tradition-culture-nostalgia-rent ceilings-jobs-diversity-etc. with one swift move of the fixie.</strong> She mentions a few articles and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeebmwdVskk">videos</a>, ones that also rush into my memory, clips or commentaries which chastise us (expats or the “new immigrants”) for simply coming and changing whatever it was that our clans were able to so rapidly and singularly change.</p>
<p>We talk about this gentrification discourse, how it somehow makes <em>Ausländerfeindlichkeit</em> (xenophobia) easier to stomach as just being <em>Anti-Gentrifizierung,</em> how it makes it ok to spit on those speaking English on the street or to hurl beer bottles from a moving car to those “talking American”. These events are close to both of us. They confound the destructive, unspoken impact of the anti-gentrification debate – <strong>the blame game that oversimplifies a capitalistic market to one facet of consumers.</strong> It is a game that assumes to know everyone’s reason for coming, for staying, and for interacting with the “locals”.</p>
<p>Animosity and stereotypes lead to fear, she tells me. Many businesses known to belong to expats in this part of Neukölln had been broken into around this time last year, windows smashed, even her café had been victim to minor altercations. But it is the fear, not the break-ins, that creates the most problems:  businesses owners labeled as “gentrifying expats” and nothing more feel pushed into a particular identity straight-jacket. M<em>any people began to blame the local [Turkish] community for the break-ins</em>, she says. This was just another group backed into a corner, youth without much to do, let alone an identity that did not come pre-packaged with a caution sign on one’s ID card. She knows how it feels, being put into a certain box. We all do.</p>
<p>Then one day, Ali walked by.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-461 aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg" alt="tumblr_ml1wf0itWm1rehyapo1_1280" width="448" height="672" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg 433w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></a><i>And it just happened organically, </i>she says. She noticed his well-put together outfits and slight swagger, asked to take his picture. Now it is a regular occurrence, though he prefers to have his picture taken only on days when he is looking snazzy&#8230;which are most days, it seems. He never leaves the house without an accessory &#8211; whether a jacket slung over the shoulder or colorful prayer beads, it represents his attitude, she says. He even began <em>to lean his shoulder back a bit in some of the photographs, working on his pose, </em>she adds with a grin.</p>
<p>There was probably a bit of intention in the first interaction, I add, <i>a connection you two shared from the start just by nature of positio</i>n. He, the assumed-<i>Gastarbeiter (</i>politically-charged term for &#8216;guest worker&#8217;) fighting against stereotypes and categorizations since arrival // she<em>,</em> the ex-pat fighting off armies of criticism for displacing the very people one considers to be neighbors: difficult situations that have arisen not out of  malice but out of circumstance, no matter the scale. She nods in agreement.</p>
<p>What began without much planning progressed effortlessly. As it turns out, they have a lot in common.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: a tenuous relationship to the German language. <i>My German is getting better because of Ali, she mentions enthusiastically. </i>She has continued to learn German slowly via Rosetta Stone, considering it a victory when she and Ali can communicate without too many halted sentences. <i>We can just communicate on basic terms, though he simplifies it down for me. </i>She laughs. <i>But I can pick out key words and we understand each other. </i>A journalist asked Zoe if Ali could speak any German. The woman <i>was surprised that he could, for his generation, at least</i>. <strong><em>He speaks German at a professional level in the shop, but he enjoys the practice with me too</em>, she adds with a smile.</strong></p>
<p>There are other similarities between the two, ones that the papers also aren’t writing about. <strong>Ali used to be a doctor in Turkey.</strong> He came to Germany as a young man seeking a better life 44 years ago &#8211; Ali is 84 years old &#8211; but found himself struggling amidst Germany’s incredibly strict immigration laws, which prevent the recognition of many accreditations achieved abroad (let alone their application in the job market). He was left an immigrant, a father &#8211; Ali has 18 children to date &#8211; without the ability to practice his profession or identity for that matter.</p>
<p>He learned the trade of tailoring, turning his white coat in for a pair of scissors. The bags seen in many of Zoe’s photos often contain his special tools, as he walks to work from his home in Neukölln<i>.<strong> I want to know why he didn’t go back</strong>,</i> <em>why he stayed,</em> she says. It is a struggle to stay, we both add. Working at a café is a step down, she explains, as she can’t afford the freelance insurance for personal reasons. <i>No one knows your story. They just make assumptions based on where they think you are from. </i>This cuts to the heart of the gentrification debate: assumptions without asking questions. And deciding to stay is a constant negotiation, I add, a constant weighing of pro&#8217;s, con&#8217;s, and dreams, even the dreams that can&#8217;t happen here.<a href="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-459 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg" alt="Ali_applepicking" width="358" height="538" srcset="http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg 433w, http://collidoscopeberlin.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /></a></p>
<p><i>Ali opens up so many doors to new experiences and opportunities</i>, she says<i>. <strong>Every time he sees me, he gives me a gift</strong></i>. This is how they first went to the apple orchards together – Ali had brought delicious apples into the Café for her; she inquired about their origin. Days later they were in the car heading to some distant field beyond Berlin to fill sacks with autumn’s fruit. She&#8217;s even attended a wedding with Ali, introduced her mother who was visiting from Australia. She often swings by his shop in the afternoons or meets him for lunch.</p>
<p>But it can&#8217;t all be apple-picking and weddings, and looming at the end of our uplifting and yet slightly sad conversation is the theme of our encounter:<strong> gentrification. <em>It is a problem</em></strong>, she reiterates, but pointing fingers at ad hoc identities without asking bigger questions isn’t finding a solution, either. It occurs to me that such encounters &#8211; like the one between Ali and Zoe &#8211;  aren&#8217;t happenstance, that even friendships between unlikely matches develop in such spaces of change and even crisis like this corner of Neukölln, especially in a city that has only known flux and adaptation to the times. Reaching out to each other in positions of out-of-placeness and marginality is more common place than we might think. <em><strong>These collisions are what keep us sane, humane, and humble. They prevent slight fissures from turning into chasms, allowing us to keep picking dem apples with neighbors quite different from our own biography.</strong></em></p>
<p>Ali and Zoe are going strawberry-picking this month. Zoe thought she would leave Berlin this spring. She’s staying a while longer, developing her friendship with Ali, and working on her photography. For now.</p>
