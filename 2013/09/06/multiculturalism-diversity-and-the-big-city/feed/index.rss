					<description><![CDATA[Hi Charisma! Thanks for your comment, and you&#039;re certainly not alone! Kelly and I also still struggle with our understanding of multiculturalism and this blog is a way for us to explore its different meanings. Your last sentence really brings out the point I was trying to make in this post, though. To say multiculturalism has failed is basically saying society has failed, in my eyes at least. Even if large immigrant populations aren&#039;t in the picture there are various forms of dominant, non-dominant, and sub cultures within any community that society must navigate through.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still shaky on the concept of multiculturalism and diversity, both in Germany and the U.S.,  Thank you so much for this article, though, especially that last paragraph. So often people (we) forget that privilege and (in)justice work in so many interconnected, complex ways, and shouldn&#039;t be read just on (or primarily) ethnic/racial terms.]]></description>
