:) it is a rich life, indeed, though sometimes a confusing one. i get better at it every day and, of course, having those people on both sides who understand and relate makes it all worth it (like you, dad). the bikers outside of Maupin just seemed quintessentially American to me, in the way I have come to understand my relationship to this &#039;other side&#039; : wild and mysterious, often a little rough at the edges, though always warm in a way only memory can make sense of...or something like that :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know the airport scene and the feeling you describe. Isn&#039;t it good to have those places where you are loved, two homes across the world?
