                    <p>You may have heard of them. Zoe takes pictures of Ali while walking down the street and posts
                        them on her tumblr called <a href="http://alioutfit.tumblr.com/">What Ali Wore</a>.</p>
                    <p>Her project has seen no shortage of attention. A few articles in
                        <a href="http://www.mitteschoen.com/2013/03/25/der-etwas-andere-fashion-blog-what-ali-wore/">local</a>
                        and
                        <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/mediacenter/fotostrecken/berlin/fotoblog-what-ali-wore/8052528.html">national</a>
                        German media, even some pieces by
                        <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/29/living/what-ali-wore-tumblr">CNN</a> and a Turkish
                        daily, and her followers went from 29 to more than 24,000. The trend of street style seems to
                        catch the most attention; his outfits boast the irony of cosmopolitan contrasts: youthful
                        pastels with a grayed moustache, prayer beads and a baseball cap, Kebab and a double-breasted
                        plaid suit. Designers have even offered to send her clothing for Ali, she tells me &#8211; to
                        dress Ali like a mannequin for a show. She declined, of course, she says a bit perturbed.</p>
                    <p>This is not just a fashion blog glorifying fabrics or cuts. A person and experience &#8211;
                        positioned in the city and its landscape &#8211; exists behind the camera, behind Ali’s swagger.
                        What beauty are we missing if we consider images simply for what they are, a blend of red
                        polyester against a backdrop of hipsterdom? This is about Ali and Zoe and their well-timed
                        collision. And it&#8217;s about gentrification. Most importantly, it&#8217;s about
                        friendship.</p>
                    <p>Let’s start from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Zoe met Ali last summer while setting up furniture outside the Café where she works on
                        Panierstraße, nestled in the booming heart of the Neukölln district. The scene is rough streets
                        meet Williamsburg ten years ago. And ‘rough’ being the Berlin variety which is, well, mild. Like
                        its American counterpart in Brooklyn, we discuss how the Café where she works and its environs
                        have been the brunt of jokes, even legitimate public attack, as of late.<strong> Affluent
                            expats, usually English-speaking, move in to transform the neighborhood with their record
                            stores and crumpet Cafés, so goes the rhetoric, destroying tradition-culture-nostalgia-rent
                            ceilings-jobs-diversity-etc. with one swift move of the fixie.</strong> She mentions a few
                        articles and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeebmwdVskk">videos</a>, ones that also
                        rush into my memory, clips or commentaries which chastise us (expats or the “new immigrants”)
                        for simply coming and changing whatever it was that our clans were able to so rapidly and
                        singularly change.</p>
                    <p>We talk about this gentrification discourse, how it somehow makes <em>Ausländerfeindlichkeit</em>
                        (xenophobia) easier to stomach as just being <em>Anti-Gentrifizierung,</em> how it makes it ok
                        to spit on those speaking English on the street or to hurl beer bottles from a moving car to
                        those “talking American”. These events are close to both of us. They confound the destructive,
                        unspoken impact of the anti-gentrification debate – <strong>the blame game that oversimplifies a
                            capitalistic market to one facet of consumers.</strong> It is a game that assumes to know
                        everyone’s reason for coming, for staying, and for interacting with the “locals”.</p>
                    <p>Animosity and stereotypes lead to fear, she tells me. Many businesses known to belong to expats
                        in this part of Neukölln had been broken into around this time last year, windows smashed, even
                        her café had been victim to minor altercations. But it is the fear, not the break-ins, that
                        creates the most problems:  businesses owners labeled as “gentrifying expats” and nothing more
                        feel pushed into a particular identity straight-jacket. M<em>any people began to blame the local
                            [Turkish] community for the break-ins</em>, she says. This was just another group backed
                        into a corner, youth without much to do, let alone an identity that did not come pre-packaged
                        with a caution sign on one’s ID card. She knows how it feels, being put into a certain box. We
                        all do.</p>
                    <p>Then one day, Ali walked by.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        <a href="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-461 aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg" alt="tumblr_ml1wf0itWm1rehyapo1_1280" width="448" height="672" srcset="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280.jpg 433../../../../assets/images/uploadsads/2013/05/tumblr_ml1wf0itwm1rehyapo1_1280-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px"/></a><i>And
                        it just happened organically, </i>she says. She noticed his well-put together outfits and slight
                        swagger, asked to take his picture. Now it is a regular occurrence, though he prefers to have
                        his picture taken only on days when he is looking snazzy&#8230;which are most days, it seems. He
                        never leaves the house without an accessory &#8211; whether a jacket slung over the shoulder or
                        colorful prayer beads, it represents his attitude, she says. He even began <em>to lean his
                        shoulder back a bit in some of the photographs, working on his pose, </em>she adds with a grin.
                    </p>
                    <p>There was probably a bit of intention in the first interaction, I add, <i>a connection you two
                        shared from the start just by nature of positio</i>n. He, the assumed-<i>Gastarbeiter (</i>politically-charged
                        term for &#8216;guest worker&#8217;) fighting against stereotypes and categorizations since
                        arrival // she<em>,</em> the ex-pat fighting off armies of criticism for displacing the very
                        people one considers to be neighbors: difficult situations that have arisen not out of  malice
                        but out of circumstance, no matter the scale. She nods in agreement.</p>
                    <p>What began without much planning progressed effortlessly. As it turns out, they have a lot in
                        common.</p>
                    <p>Exhibit A: a tenuous relationship to the German language. <i>My German is getting better because
                        of Ali, she mentions enthusiastically. </i>She has continued to learn German slowly via Rosetta
                        Stone, considering it a victory when she and Ali can communicate without too many halted
                        sentences. <i>We can just communicate on basic terms, though he simplifies it down for me. </i>She
                        laughs. <i>But I can pick out key words and we understand each other. </i>A journalist asked
                        Zoe if Ali could speak any German. The woman <i>was surprised that he could, for his generation,
                            at least</i>. <strong><em>He speaks German at a professional level in the shop, but he
                            enjoys the practice with me too</em>, she adds with a smile.</strong></p>
                    <p>There are other similarities between the two, ones that the papers also aren’t writing about.
                        <strong>Ali used to be a doctor in Turkey.</strong> He came to Germany as a young man seeking a
                        better life 44 years ago &#8211; Ali is 84 years old &#8211; but found himself struggling
                        amidst Germany’s incredibly strict immigration laws, which prevent the recognition of many
                        accreditations achieved abroad (let alone their application in the job market). He was left an
                        immigrant, a father &#8211; Ali has 18 children to date &#8211; without the ability to practice
                        his profession or identity for that matter.</p>
                    <p>He learned the trade of tailoring, turning his white coat in for a pair of scissors. The bags
                        seen in many of Zoe’s photos often contain his special tools, as he walks to work from his home
                        in Neukölln<i>.<strong> I want to know why he didn’t go back</strong>,</i> <em>why he
                            stayed,</em> she says. It is a struggle to stay, we both add. Working at a café is a step
                        down, she explains, as she can’t afford the freelance insurance for personal reasons. <i>No one
                            knows your story. They just make assumptions based on where they think you are from. </i>This
                        cuts to the heart of the gentrification debate: assumptions without asking questions. And
                        deciding to stay is a constant negotiation, I add, a constant weighing of pro&#8217;s, con&#8217;s,
                        and dreams, even the dreams that can&#8217;t happen
                        here.<a href="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-459 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" src="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg" alt="Ali_applepicking" width="358" height="538" srcset="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2013/05/ali_applepicking.jpg 433../../../../assets/images/uploadsads/2013/05/ali_applepicking-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px"/></a>
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Ali opens up so many doors to new experiences and opportunities</i>, she says<i>. <strong>Every
                        time he sees me, he gives me a gift</strong></i>. This is how they first went to the apple
                        orchards together – Ali had brought delicious apples into the Café for her; she inquired about
                        their origin. Days later they were in the car heading to some distant field beyond Berlin to
                        fill sacks with autumn’s fruit. She&#8217;s even attended a wedding with Ali, introduced her
                        mother who was visiting from Australia. She often swings by his shop in the afternoons or meets
                        him for lunch.</p>
                    <p>But it can&#8217;t all be apple-picking and weddings, and looming at the end of our uplifting and
                        yet slightly sad conversation is the theme of our encounter:<strong> gentrification. <em>It is a
                            problem</em></strong>, she reiterates, but pointing fingers at ad hoc identities without
                        asking bigger questions isn’t finding a solution, either. It occurs to me that such encounters
                        &#8211; like the one between Ali and Zoe &#8211;  aren&#8217;t happenstance, that even
                        friendships between unlikely matches develop in such spaces of change and even crisis like this
                        corner of Neukölln, especially in a city that has only known flux and adaptation to the times.
                        Reaching out to each other in positions of out-of-placeness and marginality is more common place
                        than we might think. <em><strong>These collisions are what keep us sane, humane, and humble.
                            They prevent slight fissures from turning into chasms, allowing us to keep picking dem
                            apples with neighbors quite different from our own biography.</strong></em></p>
                    <p>Ali and Zoe are going strawberry-picking this month. Zoe thought she would leave Berlin this
                        spring. She’s staying a while longer, developing her friendship with Ali, and working on her
                        photography. For now.</p>
                    <p><em>-By<strong> Kelly Miller</strong></em></p>
                    <p><em>All images of Ali were taken from Zoe&#8217;s fantastic tumblr

                            <p>You are absolutely right, Mira. I wanted it to be more an example of interaction within a
                                discourse (which often rules such encounters out, or at least in an authentic sense),
                                rather than an article about the political or economic side of the debate, which is
                                complicated and heavily layered, at best. Suffice it to say, there is a lot of
                                misunderstanding and a tendency to generalize located on both sides. I wanted to avoid
                                doing the same, and of course, be transparent in my own position as one of these
                                criticized English-speakers. Thanks for the feedback 🙂 This is, in the end, what it&#8217;s
