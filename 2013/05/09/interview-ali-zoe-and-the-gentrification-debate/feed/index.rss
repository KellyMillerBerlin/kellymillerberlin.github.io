					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] It&#8217;s an unlikely friendship between an 84-year-old Turkish physician-turned-tailor and a 29-year-old Australian photographer-cum-waitress in Berlin. Since last summer, Zoe Spawton has been taking a photograph of the smartly dressed Ali almost every day as he walks by the restaurant where she works. She noticed his fabulous fashion sense (bonus: he makes most of his own clothes) and subtle swagger, and began posting the photos on Tumblr. They have since become good friends, and the blog has amassed thousands of followers. &#8220;He thought it was funny at first,&#8221; Spawton said. &#8220;And I think he did feel a bit proud. Now he&#8217;s the one giving me instructions and showing me where he wants to pose.&#8221; [Source] [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are absolutely right, Mira. I wanted it to be more an example of interaction within a discourse (which often rules such encounters out, or at least in an authentic sense), rather than an article about the political or economic side of the debate, which is complicated and heavily layered, at best. Suffice it to say, there is a lot of misunderstanding and a tendency to generalize located on both sides. I wanted to avoid doing the same, and of course, be transparent in my own position as one of these criticized English-speakers. Thanks for the feedback :) This is, in the end, what it&#039;s all about!]]></description>
