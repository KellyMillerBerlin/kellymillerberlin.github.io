					<description><![CDATA[Reposted comment from facebook: 

i actually really liked this exhibition; not because of that marketing stunt - which is still, to be fair, just a fractional part of the whole exhibition... i thought together with the video installations and whatnot, it added a vivid and personal experience to a matter that most people only know from textbooks and from serious settings. and that is sth that fits into the concept of the museum and its permanent exhibition.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reposted comment from facebook:

I believe we agree on our reactions to this event. To think that one Jew, any Jew, can speak for or represent the entire people. culture and history is no different from picking one American, Canadian or Frenchman to speak for the entire culture, tradition and viewpoint. I can see the merit of allowing and promoting unstructured contact but I suspect it may provide a very limited and skewed snapshot rather than an opening.]]></description>
