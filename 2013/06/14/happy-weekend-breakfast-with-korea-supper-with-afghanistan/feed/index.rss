Great theme: &quot;Superstition.&quot; I&#039;d love to find out more about what others find &quot;scary or good.&quot; Let us know if you find some interesting facts. Sad that so many of the G-20 countries are not participating. Why do you think that is? Only Korea and Indonesia participated from the G-20 list?]]></description>
