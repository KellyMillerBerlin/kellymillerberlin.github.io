                    <p>This past week, I visited my good friend D who, like me, is an American transplant*. We have
                        similar trajectories and political ponderings, though his roots lie far from mine in the
                        American Deep South (here’s
                        a <a href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/place_where_you_live/view/chunky_mississippi_7753/">beautiful
                            piece</a> he wrote about his home in Mississippi). D now lives in East London, where the
                        corner store owner greets you in an upbeat banter and the sign to a ‘Carolina Fried Chicken’
                        joint dances in the light from the neighboring gastropub. Multicultural, maybe. But London’s
                        multiculturalism has a few faces and facades. And, in the end, it’s the people that matter more
                        than the cultural installation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3351 size-full" src="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg" alt="img_1031-e1413145767969" width="640" height="426" srcset="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg 640../../../../assets/images/uploadsads/2014/10/img_1031-e1413145767969-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>My first night in London, over pints at a very hip and haptic microbrewery – the tables grainy
                        and splitting with moisture – D and I discuss our common struggles: We chat about how so-called
                        experiences ‘abroad’ are, in the end, defined by labor market restrictions and the particular
                        brand of our passport. Three years ago I would have insisted that these things are fluid. But
                        even with a class degree from a class English university, a work allowance is hard to come by if
                        not impossible in an academic job market already squeezed by its nationals, he shares. I can
                        only nod, my plunge into the newest Berlin job search looming at the edge of my half-empty
                        pint.</p>
                    <p>Berlin, like London, is full of transplants, both temporary and permanent. Why so many? For the
                        case of my friend D and me, why did we, in particular, take these leaps? Why do so many of our
                        generation (and even those generations before us) move to cities in countries we have no <i>de
                            facto</i> right to be in? Across the ocean, <i>jus soli</i>, <i>jus
                            sanguinus</i>, <i>jus</i> whatever does, indeed, determine much of what is possible.</p>
                    <p>The U.K, though London, in particular, invites dreams and dreamers. Multiculturalism results, in
                        part, from the diversity of all those who believe in possibility; immigrants churn up new
                        identities and make places we feel right to inhabit. In the case of Americans in London, maybe
                        it’s the common language, the similar sarcastic humor, or the attachment to butter-heavy things
                        like pie and cookies, but it just makes sense to come here.</p>
                    <p>In D’s apartment, a short assemblage of brick and concrete in
                        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Hackney">Hackney neighborhood</a>, I
                        meet a few other fellow Americans. In many words, we all speak of the hurdles one must leap (in
                        stride) for the right to not only remain but to earn an income at that, to really participate in
                        a place one might co-construct but for which legal rights are lacking. One of them,
                        a recent graduate of the London School of Economics, is tirelessly working to bend a clause or
                        make a rule that will allow him to stay. There is a sense of marathon-running in the air, trying
                        and trying until you can’t try anymore. Particularly palpable in a generation used to succeeding
                        at most things, or told it is possible anyway.</p>
                    <p>But sometimes, it just doesn’t work out, at least temporarily, and many of those who come have to
                        return to the places they left behind. But D seems optimistic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3350 size-large" src="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3-464x650.jpg" alt="dylan_3" width="464" height="650" srcset="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/10/dylan_3.jpg 464../../../../assets/images/uploadsads/2014/10/dylan_3-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px"/></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>This matters because cities like London and Berlin actively foster the transplant spirit, but
                        this doesn’t mean that these places work to sustain it. According to recent
                        research <a href="http://books.google.de/books?id=Cy7FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=%22migrants+or+expatriates+americans+in+europe%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bX6_r-fwO2&amp;sig=4Si_8b_0M8yuiU9Ti6hBkJ_Ijs8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M8IqVJW1IsbWPZzygOAN&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">on
                            so-called American expatriates in Europe</a>, many transplants struggle for years at poorly
                        paid jobs that are taken just to remain in the country. In Berlin, nearly half are underemployed
                        and another third report contract-to-contract work (hustling, in other words). And yet, despite
                        difficulties, many stay, which may be part financial, the costs of rehabilitating a life
                        somewhere else, for example, and part mythical, i.e. what it means to constantly imagine future
                        potential, then find it too difficult to forgo what might have been.</p>
                    <p>In any case, staying has a lot to do with the appearance of things. For how much of the
                        transplant culture results from what one sees or experiences upon arriving, regardless of the
                        actual rules of the game, even in spite of real barriers to inclusion? Put simply, if I see
                        other Americans making it, or just a plethora of other nationalities making it, is it wrong to
                        think I’ll make it?</p>
                    <p>Of course, the particular brand of passport produces a variety of experiences, but very few of us
                        have a free-pass (excluding what D jokingly refers to as ‘fake Americans’ in London who legally
                        remain in the country under an inherited European passport). Now, sitting in D’s kitchen with a
                        liter of freshly brewed coffee (not tea), he tells me another story, one of a good friend’s
                        predicament – an EU citizen, married to a Mexican national. In short, the immigration
                        authorities of the U.K. have decided that the couple fails to meet requirements for residency in
                        London, he tells me. Mexico is a country not seen favorably for transplantation; a hierarchy of
                        acceptable migrants certainly does exist. But this all feels strangely hypothetical – this game
                        of planning a life beyond borders, making moves and readying oneself for the counter. It is a
                        lesson in rectifying a roster of rules with a vibrant diversity suggestive of more flexibility,
                        more fluidity, than might be the case.</p>
                    <p>We leave the apartment and its conversation for a walk. Outside, it’s humid but pleasant, and the
                        streets of D’s neighborhood are bursting with an eclecticism even beyond what the NY
                        Times recently featured in
                        ‘<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/travel/36-hours-in-east-london.html">36 hours in
                            East London</a>‘ (as if the region needed its own holiday, apart from the financial men and
                        women in suits of central London or the manicured streets of the West). Here, social housing
                        projects tower above quaint town homes, neighbors trimming their rose bushes, bass piling out of
                        a high window onto a long set of shears. Just down the road, one of London’s most bubbling
                        food bazaars – a foodie’s scene of cultural consumption – is in full swing. Broadway Market:
                        where German sausages, and meat pies, and lox bagels, and Persian kebab, and samosas, and
                        ramen-to-go find frequent (young) patrons. We both delight in the anything-but-discordant
                        multilingualism this variety yields.</p>
                    <p>In a pod of food carts just blocks from the market’s main drag, I find the best burrito I’ve had
                        outside of the Western United States – a man with an air of L.A. dishing up marinated legumes,
                        sauces streaming out of all sides of the tortilla like a blessing. A neighboring kiosk serves up
                        what they call Filipino wraps (pork belly, assorted greens, tangy sauce), D’s favorite. As I
                        walk to peruse other flavors, D shares his visa predicament with the owner of the wraps,
                        explaining that this sandwich will be his last after a year of patronage. The owner offers to
                        sponsor his visa, chuckling but serious, D tells me. Maybe he should take him up on his offer we
                        joke, meaning it. D smiles.</p>

                    <p>It’s easy to feel welcomed here.</p>
                    <p>Far away from East London, I find myself in the kitchen of a German transplant on the ground
                        floor of an elderly but charming home in a neighborhood near Kensington.  From my luggage I
                        unload mustard I’ve carted across the channel, tubes I was almost not allowed to take onto the
                        plane. <i>You just can’t find this here</i>, my host says, that certain spicy mustard.</p>
                    <p>Her friends are all from somewhere else, she shares, <i>but the problem with transplants is that
                        they all leave eventually, and then, all of a sudden, you don’t have any friends</i>. She is
                        slowly rebuilding the circle, <i>but it’s hard</i>, she tells me, <i>when everyone is from

                    <p>As we leave the far West neighborhood, its quiet lanes juxtaposed with newer blocks of community
                        housing and industrial outgrowth, we pass an office for remittances – transplants from East
                        Africa sending their earnings back ‘home’. Even here, some people are making it.</p>

                    <p>My last day in London, my travel companion and I board a train to Brick Lane, snaking above a
                        meat market, halal lambs hanging like carpets and voices rising up into numbers. Brick Lane, a
                        curated experience of all that London attracts, the object of film, book, and tourism, is the
                        sharpened edge of the city’s sale of eclecticism. It is a blend of curry houses and backdoor
                        sweets shops for tourists and locals alike; it is the contrast between posh chocolatiers and
                        wholesale textile vendors or between grunge coffee houses and chic boutiques. But it is not what
                        is seen here that inspires but what is implied: that this – reproduction of home,
                        community-making in memory – is possible. Even if it always isn’t.</p>
                    <p>After another burrito, this time seasoned with garam masala, we chat with an artist crafting
                        overt social commentary, something he calls ‘the Prejudice Project’. With a long beard and dark
                        eyes, he has likely faced that which his project targets. His bright smile opens up to pure
                        optimism as we discuss diversity politics, however. But things can be difficult, indeed: In
                        London, it’s not as free as in Berlin, he shares, a place he once inhabited, squatting in
                        Köpenick and composing works that now hang in this design outlet just off Brick Lane. <i>The
                            folks here are different</i>, he says, pausing, belonging to a <i>certain type</i>. He gives
                        me a postcard, <i>a token to remember our conversation</i>: ‘#Paradise’ printed on a white
                        surface, a glimpse of blue sky in the background.</p>
                    <p>D is moving back to the United States. After a preliminary job search and the weight of a
                        different kind of bureaucracy on his shoulders, it seems like the best thing, for now. As
                        he prepares for his departure to Philadelphia he looks mournful, visiting his favorite food
                        carts and bookshop, the dingy canal with folks living out of boats – the air thick with oil and
                        wet brush – before it all becomes just another place where he once lived. <i>I’d like to come
                            back</i>, he says, <i>but then I just walk around and look at all the people here and want
                            to go up and ask ‘like, how do you live here? What do you do?’</i> Perhaps, many of them are
                        themselves transplants, just figuring it out as they go, leaving eventually for another place.
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s hard to say, given the look of things.</p>

                    <p>*I am using this word “transplant” intentionally, avoiding terms such as “expat” or even
                        “immigrant”, as they are often bogged down with allusions to class, privilege, and assumptions
                        about the irrelevance of borders or passports for certain members of the global community. When
                        it comes to migration, the language is tricky but important. It helps to start with words that
                        we feel we truly inhabit or experience, even if imperfectly.</p>
