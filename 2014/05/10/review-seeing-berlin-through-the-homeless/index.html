                    <p>In Berlin they are especially visible on the <em>Bahn</em>. They wait for the subway doors to
                        close before they address the car with a rehearsed speech. <em>Excuse the interruption, I am one
                            of Berlin&#8217;s annoying homeless people&#8230;</em> it usually begins, as they peddle
                        newspapers and scan<em> </em>the crowd for an outstretched hand holding change or food. The
                        majority of us keep our hands tucked away or firmly gripping our phones. Some of us fall into
                        convenient bouts of exhaustion, promptly leaning back and closing our eyes. In this moment, we
                        are restricted to a moving car, a shared space. We can&#8217;t dodge a corner or cross the
                        street, but we still find ways to make them invisible. We don&#8217;t look up because we feel
                        uncomfortable. We become frustrated at them for making us feel this way. We may even become
                        angry &#8211; at them, at society, at ourselves.</p>
                    <p>How the simple presence of one person can incite so much emotion, judgement, and shame.</p>
                    <p>How it must feel, to be simultaneously so visible and invisible.</p>

                    <p><em>It&#8217;s one of the worst things for homeless people, being treated as invisible. Answer
                        them when they speak to you, make eye contact, acknowledge them!</em> our guide Carsten Voss
                        urges us by the end of our walk. We are wrapping up a tour called &#8220;Obdachslose zeigen ihr
                        Berlin&#8221; (The homeless present their Berlin), run by non-profit organization <em>Querstadtein. </em>The
                        group offers tours in <span class="st">Schöneberg</span> and Mitte that show the reality of
                        homelessness in the city.</p>
                    <p>Our guide speaks from personal experience. Decked out in designer glasses and a well-fitting
                        sweater, it&#8217;s challenging to picture this man as the subject of the powerful story he
                        delivers in front of stately <span class="st">Viktoria-Luise-Platz</span>. Carsten worked 80+
                        hours a week as a manager of an international tradeshow before burning-out and falling into
                        depression. First came the loss of his job, then his apartment. He refused help from loved ones,
                        other than taking refuge in a friend&#8217;s shed for a few months. It would be a year before he
                        clawed his way back out. He cites one defining moment: <em>I happened to glance into someone&#8217;s
                            window from the street. The woman was cooking and the man was watching </em>Tagesschau<em>
                            on TV&#8230; I realized that if I didn&#8217;t make a change then, I would never have that
                            again.</em></p>
                    <p>That year Carsten counted among Berlin&#8217;s estimated 4,000 <em>Obdachslose</em> (literally
                        translates to &#8220;without shelter&#8221;). Not to be confused with <em>Wohnungslose</em> (&#8220;house-less&#8221;),
                        which refers to those without homes but still in the system, <em>Obdachslose</em> are no longer
                        in the system and may or may not have a place to sleep. Berlin has Germany&#8217;s highest
                        concentration of <em>Obdachslose, </em>both from within and outside of the country.</p>
                    <p><em>There are three main categories of </em>Obdachslose <em>in Berlin</em>, Carsten explains
                        early on in the tour. <em>Former refugees from East Germany, those groups of young people who
                            usually have dogs with them, and immigrants.<br/>
                        </em></p>
                    <p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1061&amp;langId=en">Migrant homelessness
                        throughout the EU</a> has risen in recent years, exacerbated by the economic crisis. This may
                        come as no great surprise, though it&#8217;s a blow to hear that many in Berlin<em> end up
                            staying because they find the conditions of being homeless here better than their lives back
                            home. </em>Carsten describes this group in three geographic waves: the first from Poland,
                        second from the Baltics, and third from Bulgaria and Romania<em>. Of course they came here
                            planning to find jobs, start families, create a life. Some make it, but many
                            don&#8217;t. </em></p>

                    <p>Berlin has a long tradition of homelessness. It&#8217;s a poor city &#8211; Germany&#8217;s
                        poorest &#8211; but also equipped with robust social services. Berlin has a history of
                        attracting those who are &#8220;different&#8221;, including many immigrants, due to its
                        diversity and tolerant atmosphere. During the days of the Berlin Wall, it was also a haven for
                        males escaping military conscription (which ended altogether in 2011). Carsten moved to Berlin
                        for this reason, and says he and many others like him entered fields like social work and
                        education. This, he claims, has contributed to the city&#8217;s liberal nature and strong social
                        net.</p>
                    <p>Berlin&#8217;s homeless tend to cluster in <span class="st">Schöneberg</span> and Charlottenburg,
                        two districts in West Berlin now more associated with high rents and artisanal cafes than
                        alternative lifestyles. Carsten guides us to Nollendorfplatz, Berlin&#8217;s LGBT hub and site
                        of the annual pride parade, Christopher Street Day. We stand across from the colorful <em>Regenbogen-Stele, </em>a
                        r<span class="userContent">ainbow column erected in 2000 to celebrate the area&#8217;s high concentration of homosexual residents and open-minded atmosp<span class="text_exposed_show">here. The statue itself carries two symbols: the rainbow flag for gay pride and the <em>Rosa Winkel</em>, a pink badge first used by Nazis to distinguish homosexuals in concentration camps, and what later became an international symbol for gay rights.<br/>

                            or rainbow column celebrating gay rights</p></div>
                    <p>As we inspect the square, Carsten points out what our untrained eyes fail to see: a 24-hour
                        grocery store well-equipped with bottle deposit machines, a van selling the street newspaper, a
                        well-lit intersection. <em>Homeless people are part of this neighborhood, they have a community
                            here</em>, he says.</p>
                    <p>But another faction of the city&#8217;s homeless blend in so well that we don&#8217;t see them at
                        all. <em>Most people have an image in mind of the bag lady (or guy), unkempt and dirty, pushing
                            around a cart filled to the brim with random items, muttering crazy things to
                            themselves.</em>.<em>. most homeless people don&#8217;t look or act like that. </em> Carsten
                        estimates that 60% fall into this category, homeless people who look &#8220;normal&#8221; so
                        they can use spaces and services within the city without being noticed. They schedule their day
                        in such a way that they always have a place to be, something to eat, even a bed to sleep in.
                        They know when the citizens&#8217; office opens and when they can grab a shower, when they can
                        rest in the library or supermarket, who is offering a free lunch or haircut in the city. <em>It&#8217;s
                            an exhausting life, they have to be very organized, and they are constantly in public</em>,

                    <p>Carsten&#8217;s happy ending is a welcome take-away from an otherwise harrowing topic, but he
                        warns against the assumption that all homeless people are unhappy or need to be saved. While
                        many do suffer from mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse, others have deliberately chosen
                        this lifestyle. <em>Some people want to live this way, and we have to respect that. We have to
                            recognize them as part of society.</em></p>
