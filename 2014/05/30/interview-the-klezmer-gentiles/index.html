                    <p><em>An interview is never one-sided &#8211; in fact, it is a constructive conversation. I am as
                        much a part of this piece as the artist who answered my questions. Without the contributions of
                        the other, individual statements would hold little significance. So thanks, Soli, for letting me
                        share our conversation. </em></p>
                    <p>International artists in Berlin are one category of newcomers who, although shaping the cultural
                        politics and economic fabric of Berlin perhaps more than other groups of foreign residents
                        (those without German citizenship), are often left out of the
                        <a href="../../../04/11/integration-in-berlin-research-for-a-desolate-landscape/index.html">critical
                            integration debate</a>. Whether or not they learn German or German constitutional law seems
                        to matter little to the politicians and journalists fueling the heavily institutionalized,
                        assimilating discourse. I have yet to meet an artist who has been pressured by the authorities
                        to &#8216;integrate&#8217; him or herself, as is the case with members of different social and
                        economic groups.</p>
                    <p>This semi-privileged position has its benefits: Berlin&#8217;s creatives are often able to ask
                        critical questions of society without being publicly rebuked, far enough from local history to
                        recognize nuance and apply cultural critique in a non-threatening fashion.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>An example of such an artist is an old friend <a href="http://www.solimanlawrence.com/">Soliman
                        Lawrence</a>. Soli has been photographing the memorialization of Jewish culture in Poland for
                        years, following the tracks of a new form of engagement with the past, as enacted by a more
                        recent generation of Poles. His collection of work is titled
                        &#8220;<a href="http://www.solimanlawrence.com/unquietplacesphoto.html">For those whose faith
                            has been broken</a>&#8220;. They do so, as Soliman&#8217;s stories and their pictures
                        explain, through ritual, one example of which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klezmer">Klezmer</a>
                        music. The fascinating part of this story: there are few Jews to speak of in Poland.</p>
                    <p>Beyond a revived Klezmer tradition, Soliman photographs reconstructed synagogues, Jewish-themed
                        festivals, hand-made figurines, the maintenance of Jewish cemeteries &#8211; all weaving a tale
                        of things past, now re-born as an ode to matzo ball soup or rabbinical characters.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/05/photo-11.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2681 size-large" src="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/05/photo-11%EF%B9%96w=640.jpg" alt="Jews Poland" width="640" height="423" srcset="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/05/photo-11.jpg 700../../../../assets/images/uploadsads/2014/05/photo-11-300x198.jpg ../../../../assets/images/uploadsploads/2014/05/photo-11-650x429.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Soliman is not Jewish, though his choice of topic likely gets many thinking that personal
                        biography must inform the interest. I met with Soliman at a little cafe in Neukölln to talk art,
                        history, and memory. Parallels between German memorialization of Jewish culture in Berlin and
                        that which is happening in Poland were not at the tip of his tongue; these parallels were on the
                        tip of mine, however.</p>
                    <p>Soliman is American by passport, has been a Berlin resident for more than 8 years, making the
                        nationality question a bit tricky. He studied philosophy in the United States, stems originally
                        from the Northern part of Florida, and has a contemplative way about him &#8211; he seems to
                        move slowly, take things in and digest them before forming an opinion.</p>
                    <p>His artistic career began with a camera, has now evolved into a sort of philosophical exploration
                        of what it means to remember. <em>Memory is at the center of my work</em>, he tells me, <em>how
                            people remember after something has passed, how they remember together</em>. He is
                        interested in the idea of <em><a href="http://www.postmemory.net/">post-memory</a>, the ways in
                            which memory stays alive without the original witnesses</em>. Photography serves a crucial
                        purpose, documentation allowing for connection.</p>
                    <p>Soliman first started making trips to Poland in 2006, visiting the growing Klezmer festivals in
                        places like Krakaw. <em>Here is the biggest and best festival in Poland</em>, he tells me. I
                        imagine VW buses jammed full with young, alternative Poles, spending warm nights outdoors, not
                        for the beat of electronic sounds but for renditions of clarinet and fiddle. Actually, <em>it is
                            quite mixed</em>, he tells me: young/old, hip/not.</p>
                    <p><em>When I first showed up in Krakaw, I was taking pictures of everything. I assumed a lot of the
                        stuff I was photographing had something to do with Antisemitism &#8211; graffiti on the walls
                        somehow looked antisemitic to me, these little tiles in the main square with five-pointed
                        stars</em>, <em>for example</em>, he says with a laugh. <em>Then I realized that these stars
                        were actually six-pointed, so </em>not <em>necessarily</em> <em>antisemitic</em>. <em>Very
                        often, one finds what one searches for</em>, I add. This is even more true for a photographer,
                        able to capture and catalog what may be happenstance occurrence, curating images into some sort
                        of narrative about a people or place.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2682 size-large" src="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6%EF%B9%96w=640.jpg" alt="Jews Poland Klezmer" width="640" height="426" srcset="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6.jpg 700../../../../assets/images/uploadsads/2014/05/soli_photo-6-300x200.jpg ../../../../assets/images/uploadsploads/2014/05/soli_photo-6-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Antisemitism isn&#8217;t present in Polish society, however: <em>it&#8217;s
                        complicated</em>, he says. An interview with Soliman on Jewish memorial culture in Poland
                        appeared in 2012 in <em>die</em> <i>Zeit Online </i>with the headline: &#8220;<em>Wie
                            Nicht-Juden die jüdische Kultur Polens
                            wiederbeleben/</em> &#8220;<a href="http://www.zeit.de/video/2012-12/2032360755001/holocaust-wie-nicht-juden-die-juedische-kultur-polens-wiederbeleben">How
                            Non-Jews Are Resurrecting Poland&#8217;s Jewish Culture</a>&#8220;. I recall watching the
                        interview then, having heard of the beginnings of his Polish adventures back in 2010, when Soli
                        and I first met, and being struck by the oddity of it all, the sense of a manufactured
                        experience to take the place of an entire culture now lost. And yet, it was impossible not to
                        find parallels with the city we both share, I felt: the way in which memory of Jewish culture in
                        Berlin is fractured between recreations of the diaspora experience, a come-back Jewish culture
                        in Germany, and a newer wave of young Israelis.</p>
                    <p>Soli has given quite a number of interviews in Germany since his project first began to
                        receive attention. A
                        <a href="http://juedische-woche-dresden.de/veranstaltung-2013/items/108.html">recent exhibition
                            of his work in Dresden</a> put him into more contact with the German media. <em>So, did any
                            of these journalists ask about your thoughts on Jewish memorialization in Germany, in
                            Berlin, or on any similarities between Poland and Germany?</em>, I ask. At first, he doesn&#8217;t
                        understand my question, seems a bit perplexed. Then, <em>No</em>,<em> in fact, no one even got
                            close to formulating that question. Interesting that you bring that up. </em></p>
                    <p>Jewish culture in Berlin is diffuse, hard to put a finger on, as &#8211; with Jews everywhere
                        &#8211; there is no one way to be Jewish and certainly no one way to be Jewish in Berlin. A
                        memorial culture is also difficult to construct, when Jews are in fact present. To boot, there
                        is no <em>one</em> way to memorialize the Holocaust and the thriving Jewish culture in Germany
                        that preceded it. At least no one way that would satisfy the diverse groups who were affected by
                        the genocide. In Poland, very little has happened at an institutional, top-down level. And so
                        revivals of classic Ashkenazi traditions like Klezmer have been a means of memorializing a lost
                        sector of Polish life, many years after its musicians were made to disappear.</p>
                    <p><em>At my first Klezmer festival, I didn&#8217;t really know what to do with myself. People were
                        dancing, it was celebratory, there was this feeling of community</em>, he says. He was a bit
                        stand-offish, not understanding why active participation was required. <em>This is the
                            ritual</em>, he explains, <em>it is through such a collective ritual that some form of
                            memory is reconstructed and created for the next generation.</em> <em>Many of these young
                            people probably have no real connection to contemporary Jewish people</em>, he adds,<em> but
                            this type of memory doesn&#8217;t require personal connection, rather an attachment to space
                            and a desire to make a place &#8211; a memorial &#8211; out of it.</em></p>
                    <p>In Berlin, there is a strong attention to memorial sites or objects &#8211; the
                        <a href="http://www.stolpersteine-berlin.de/en/stolpersteine"><em>Stolpersteine</em></a>,
                        <a href="http://www.holocaust-mahnmal.de/en"><em>Memorial to the Murdered Jews of
                            Europe</em></a>, <a href="http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/touching-berlins-ghosts/"><em>Bayerisches
                            Viertel</em></a>, to name a few. These are spaces that are visited and even organized by
                        many but are perhaps not as interactive or collective as a Klezmer ritual. One might simply
                        pass by its insignia, whereas Klezmer is somehow a more active process, Soli explains.</p>

                    <p><em>But are these Klezmer festivals in Poland really about remembering and mourning the
                        Holocaust? </em>I ask. <em>Yes, it is about that but not only about that.</em> <em>It is about
                        thinking about the Jews that were once here, by people who were too young to have had the
                        chance</em>.</p>
                    <p>There is a tendency<em> </em>in memorializing activities to focus on objects and their stories;
                        materiality is desired, physical connection reconstructed. The Holocaust documentation and
                        education center where I used to work curated a collection called

                    <p><em>When talking with journalists, they just don&#8217;t really understand why Klezmer music is
                        so popular in Poland, </em>Soli comments, as if to emphasize the stark differences between the
                        German memory process and that of the Poland he knows:<em> Memory is expressed differently
                            across space.</em> <em>My work is about these different memory ways, memory forms. </em></p>
                    <p>Surprising to many, Berlin is home to a fair number of Jews, and not just returned German Jews or
                        those that fled from the former Soviet Union, but Israeli Jews, secular Israelis, secular
                        Diaspora Jews from Argentina etc. &#8211; colliding in one city, not necessarily finding
                        community among one another, because why should they? To make the argument, however, that
                        perhaps things aren&#8217;t as different as they seem, I add that one does see a sort of
                        stereotypical Jewish culture in Berlin, from the
                        <a href="http://www.exberliner.com/locations/luigi-zuckermann-deli/">classic
                            deli</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>serving pastrami sandwiches to the
                        local bagel shop. Both places in mind are not run by anyone of Jewish heritage, catering to a
                        historic Jewish culture, perhaps even to New York Jewry rather than Berlin. This is not to say
                        that there are no Jewish delis or bagel shops in Berlin that are owned by Jews. <em>But might
                            the more theatrical recreations be a form of memorial culture, similar to Klezmer
                            festivals?</em> I ask. <em>Maybe</em>, he says, <em>but I know a  few Israelis, and they don&#8217;t
                            necessarily eat bagels. They go to this one shop on </em>Sonnenallee<em> where they can get
                            hummus served warm, like back home in Israel</em>.</p>
                    <p>The varied layers of Jewish culture, identity, and memory in the Berlin landscape prevent one
                        from making any static comparison to the situation in Poland, it seems &#8211; a place with very
                        few Jews to speak of and a history wrought with a non-institutionalized form of memory, at least
                        until recently. The Israeli and general Jewish presence in Berlin further complicates a
                        comparison between the memory culture of Poland and that of Berlin in a very real sense. To be
                        the authors of a tradition that re-appropriates Jewish tradition means being responsible for
                        potential misappropriation. In Poland, I doubt there are too many active members of the Jewish
                        community who would heavily criticize the rebirth of Klezmer in this form. <em>There aren&#8217;t</em>,
                        Soli says.</p>

                    <p>If he feels strange about researching this issue as an American artist without Jewish descent
                        &#8211; <em>No</em>. The Holocaust is a large part of how Americans understand Germany, I add,
                        in order validate his work from a place of personal opinion. The past was certainly a key

                    <p>The question is, if such a connection between a bleak past and curious future can be made,
                        productively, and with much room for nuance and reflection. Soliman Lawrence&#8217;s work allows
                        for just that. Like other artists, he is able to describe memory ways as they are occurring, not
                        overtly criticizing but allowing others to draw their own conclusions or parallels.</p>
                    <p>We all remember differently. The most important thing is simply to remember.</p>
