                        different? </strong></p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/01/2013-12-29-13-33-30.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/01/2013-12-29-13-33-30%EF%B9%96w=640.jpg" alt="2013-12-29 13.33.30" width="634" height="537"/></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>For about three weeks this holiday season, I explored the small tear-shaped island of Sri Lanka
                        with a close friend from Berlin. Though Sri Lanka and the South Asia region were new terrain for
                        us both, this wasn&#8217;t our first backpacking rodeo. We were experienced enough travelers to
                        expect the ups and downs that a trip of this magnitude would throw our way. We reveled in the
                        highs &#8211; a school of fish gracefully drifting past us 12m deep into the Indian Ocean, the
                        exquisitely pungent scents and colors of turmeric and homemade roasted curry powder, a 360
                        degree view of the greenest green imaginable in tea plantation territory, a monk whipping out
                        his iPad to snap a photo of us hiking. And we did our best to laugh through the lows &#8211; a
                        seven hour train ride on the ground by the toilets, being followed and sexually propositioned by
                        a strange man on a dark road, accidentally paying our safari jeep driver twice, the ruthless
                        mosquitos that left me with infected foot wounds I&#8217;m still watching heal.</p>
                    <p>But these moments were the superlatives, the stand-outs. When traveling in a place where we
                        expect everything to be different, we may become so focused on the exotic and extreme that we
                        overlook the &#8220;in-between&#8221;: the nuances that expose intricate relationships and
                        interconnections, diversity within diversity, and differences among difference.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nuances matter<br/>
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>It took one quick glance at a <em>Sari</em> for me to have an idea about modesty in Sri Lankan
                        female dress (&#8220;they can show their bellies and backs but not their shoulders and knees?!&#8221;).
                        One trip to the bathroom with an unusually low toilet seat had me wondering if Sri Lankans were
                        all very short (&#8220;are all toilets going to be like this?!&#8221;). In other words, I had
                        made my first assumptions about Sri Lankan culture before even leaving the airport. Correction:
                        <em>Before leaving passport control</em>. A few minutes upon arrival and my brain was on
                        overdrive, actively seeking out the exciting, frantically trying to affirm preconceived ideas
                        and make connections. Maybe fatigue, definitely curiosity, likely a survival instinct. I
                        desperately wanted to &#8220;understand&#8221; the place in which I was going to be spending the
                        next three weeks of my life, but I was primarily doing so on a larger, generalizing scale. While
                        my mind naturally looks for nuances and intricacy at home, it took an active effort to protest
                        generalizing abroad. Otherwise my mind would have continued to host its very own

                        subtleties.</p>

                    <p><strong><strong>It&#8217;s sometimes not about what we say, but what we don&#8217;t<br/>
                    </strong></strong></p>
                    <p>Once we made it out of the airport, Anna and I encountered the &#8220;Your country?&#8221; or
                        &#8220;Madame, you are from?&#8221; question at a rate of approximately once per hour. While I
                        would ponder how to put &#8220;Well actually, we met in Buenos Aires, Anna is German but spent
                        half her life in England, I grew up in the U.S. but have a German passport, we live in Germany
                        but speak English together&#8221; into one concise thought, Anna was usually quick to respond
                        with &#8220;Germany&#8221;. Considering how much
                        <a href="../../../../2013/11/11/lens-with-wings-roots-and-sweaty-hands/index.html">this type of
                            question can provoke discussion and bother me at home</a>, I was surprised at how quickly I
                        followed suit and resigned myself to the &#8220;put me in a box&#8221; game. On top of that, I
                        was doing the same in return, never going beyond the &#8220;do you come from this town?&#8221;
                        question with locals. Granted, not every conversation while traveling has to be life-altering,
                        and language often poses a barrier, but opportunities were surely missed to explore our
                        understanding of identity and (inter-)nationality. The one-word response was convenient not only
                        because it was quick &#8211; it facilitated our interactions and put them at a comfortable
                        status quo. &#8220;I am a German tourist and you are a Sri Lankan local&#8221; was never the
                        whole story, but it was story enough. But what about the stories we missed?</p>

                    <p>&#8220;Ahhhhaaaa,&#8221; the Tuk-Tuk driver or waiter would say after we answered the above, a
                        knowing smile on his face, &#8220;<em>Alles klar</em>?&#8221; The surprise of Sri Lankans
                        speaking a few words of German faded rapidly as we realized the extent of German tourism to Sri
                        Lanka (It&#8217;s the
                        <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-17/sri-lanka-s-may-tourist-arrivals-by-country-table-.html">third
                            largest visitor-generating market</a> to Sri Lanka after India and the UK). We spent two
                        fateful days on Beruwala beach experiencing the extent of Teutonic tourism: in a German-run
                        resort surrounded by a predominantly German clientele eating from a menu complete with &#8220;German
                        specialities&#8221; (Schnitzel with a view, anyone?), marking their beach-chair territory at the
                        break of dawn, and interacting with Sri Lankans only when they needed their next smoothie.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/02/2014-01-05-10-13-31.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2081" src="../../../../assets/images/uploads/2014/02/2014-01-05-10-13-31%EF%B9%96w=640.jpg" alt="2014-01-05 10.13.31" width="640" height="480"/></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Yet tourism turned out to be only the tip of the Sri Lankan-German-Iceberg. More often than not,
                        our Sri Lankan inquirer would proceed to tell us about his brother who works in a restaurant in
                        Düsseldorf, his university studies in Heidelberg, her father&#8217;s German friends who came to
                        visit every year, his decision to pursue science thanks to Einstein, even that we looked like we
                        came from Munich (ouch). One guesthouse employee donned a shirt with German and Sri Lankan flags
                        that he got from the local German-run <em>Kinderheim.</em> On one bus ride, we rolled by a
                        station donated by Germans. In Galle, a shopkeeper recited the last eight German Chancellors to
                        us in chronological order. The relationship between these two countries repeatedly smacked us in
                        the face, each day and in every which direction.</p>

                    <p>The Sri Lankans we encountered were much more aware of Germany and Germans than we had expected.
                        But what about the reverse &#8211; the German perception of this dynamic, continually evolving,
                        and surprisingly multifaceted bi-national relationship? My instinct is that when Germans think
                        of Sri Lanka, they picture pristine beaches, coconut trees, people eating with their hands, and
                        maybe a country re-emerging after the longest war in Asia&#8217;s history. I&#8217;m less
                        confident that they see a legacy of exchange, generation-long friendships, or a cab driver
                        studying science because of Einstein. My hopes remain low after the doctor inspecting my foot
                        wounds back in Berlin asked if they &#8220;also speak Indian there?&#8221;, and I was unable to
                        find any substantial information online about Sri Lankans in Berlin, other than

                        (<a href="https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Publikationen/Stat_Berichte/2013/SB_A01-05-00_2012h02_BE.pdf">1,113

                        think.</p>
                    <p>After three weeks in the most &#8220;exotic&#8221; place I&#8217;ve ever visited, my most
                        striking take-away is that an authentic travel experience must extend beyond exoticism. To
                        really understand what it means to be Sri Lankan, German, or anything else, it is perhaps the
                        nuances that count the most.</p>
