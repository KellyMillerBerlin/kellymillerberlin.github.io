There are more than 4,500\u00a0participants in the parade and fair,\u00a0leaving many of these cultures\u00a0untouched, I&#8217;m afraid.<\/p>\n<p>At\u00a0Hallesches Tor, food, drink, and musical merriment will give quite an entertaining glimpse of Berlin&#8217;s official multiculturalism, even if it is just a beginning. Shots of Arak on ice or fried plantains with peanut sauce, \u2018authentic\u2019 cuisine from the familiar Polish pierogi to the distant Equadorian empanada, soft serve ice cream and funnel cake served in dishes with the American flag &#8211; there is no shortage of interesting eats.<\/p>\n<p>A\u00a0collection of stages expose visitors to everything from \u2018Mestizo rock\u2019 to Balkan brass with plenty of room to dance (and there will be dancing, if my previous experience has taught my worn-out feet anything); wares from Africa &#8211; region often unspecified &#8211; blend with specialty teas from the Middle East, often advertised as &#8216;tastes from the Orient&#8217;; drum circles abound, as do slack-lining youth and spontaneous picnics. The combinations and divisions from one supposed culture\u00a0&#8211; one\u00a0<em>Kulturkreis\u00a0&#8211;<\/em>\u00a0to the next are sometimes interesting, sometimes decidedly humorous.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnevalderkulturen_women.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-628 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnevalderkulturen_women.jpg\" alt=\"KarnevalderKulturen_women\" width=\"512\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnevalderkulturen_women.jpg 700w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnevalderkulturen_women-300x198.jpg 300w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnevalderkulturen_women-650x429.jpg 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The parade is the true highlight, beginning\u00a0tomorrow at 12:30 at Hermannplatz and continuing on to Yorckstra\u00dfe. 79 groups, representing\u00a0a \u2018culture\u2019 or ethnic identification within Berlin, are registered to participate. The registration process\u00a0is important\u00a0in gaining recognition as a cultural unit within the German system. As a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.taz.de\/!66525\/\">Berlin-based anthropologist<\/a> described it, wearing a mask at Karneval der Kulturen is a form of willing integration. Implicit in this statement is the critique of the official dressing-up of cultures, the categorization of different ways of life, and the parading of such in vibrant and exoticized forms.<\/p>\n<p>It is no coincidence that Karneval der Kulturen was an initiative of the office for migration and integration in 1993, and no coincidence that some groups are always represented in extravagance, while others remain nearly hidden from view. Putting a city&#8217;s multiculturalism\u00a0out on display can be an opportunity for inclusion and appreciation of diversity; it\u00a0can also be an opportunity for classification and typification of <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/2013\/04\/23\/over-and-over\/\">identities<\/a>, ignoring the splendid diversity occurring <i>between categories and across them<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnivalderkulturen_parade.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-625 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnivalderkulturen_parade.jpg\" alt=\"karnivalderkulturen_parade\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnivalderkulturen_parade.jpg 460w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/karnivalderkulturen_parade-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>At last year\u2019s Karneval der Kulturen, I found myself twirling in the warm air to the sounds of \u2018gypsy music\u2019 by a Hungarian band with a group of Germans, Americans, and Iranians. We devoured Hombow and Senegalese fries, giving culinary recommendations to a banker in a suit from Paris.<\/p>\n<p>For all the official critiques of the event and the hope that it will grow with the city in its definitions and portrayals, there has got to be something said for the\u00a0pleasant\u00a0intercultural encounter the Karneval affords. Just be sure when photographing the half-naked women in golden headdress to recognize what we might not be seeing: which groups do not dare to participate\u00a0in the official display,\u00a0which\u00a0cultures fear \u00a0walking the streets freely, or which have nothing &#8216;exotic&#8217; to represent.\u00a0Most importantly, it might be interesting to truly ask how one captures a culture in a costume, in a plastic cup, or on a plate&#8230;the jury is still out on that one.<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time, viva Karneval der Kulturen!<\/p>\n<p><em>-By <strong>Kelly Miller<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Photo source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.karneval-berlin.de\/de\/\">Karneval der Kulturen e.V.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What if the local government wanted to take stock of its cultures, parade its diversity through the city streets \u2013 what would you wear to participate?
