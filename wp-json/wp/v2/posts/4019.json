Born in Taiwan to a Taiwanese mother and Austrian father, at age three her family moved to San Jose, California, where her younger brother was born. Kindergarten was spent in Vienna, where she lived with her father and grandparents while mom and brother stayed in the US. At age six the entire family moved to Taiwan for four years. Then it was back west to Seattle from ages 10-16 where Christina spent the longest stretch of her childhood, what she calls her &#8220;most formative years&#8221;.

The recurring theme? If you are one drop of minority, we will question your Belonging to the majority.<\/p>\n<p>Christina acknowledges that even she is not immune to societal attitudes about migrants in Austria. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned that, in Austria, migrants get classified into &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217;,&#8221; she explains.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Asians are considered \u2018good\u2019 because they\u2019re quiet, stay out of trouble, and work hard. Turkish people are unpopular because a lot of them refuse to adapt to the Austrian way of life and bring hordes of family members over, all the while claiming benefits from the Austrian government.

Her most recent attempt at the <a href=\"http:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/visas\/english\/immigrate\/diversity-visa\/instructions.html\">Diversity Visa Lottery<\/a> was unsuccessful. \u201cMy dad told me he is reconsidering becoming an American citizen just so that he can help get us over there,\u201d Christina recently shared. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.migrationpolicy.org\/article\/family-reunification\">Family reunification<\/a> is one of the four major pathways for foreigners to become legal residents of the US.<\/p>\n<p>Legal challenges are also not Christina\u2019s only concern. \u201cSometimes I worry that people in the US will annoy me with their ignorance,\u201d she says laughing. At the same time, she is drawn to the lifestyle. She observes her American friends move to houses with pools, which, compared to Viennese city apartments, seem like mansions. Illy, a recovering Justin Bieber addict who recently graduated to a One Direction obsession, is thrilled with the prospect. \u201cA typical Austrian teenager,\u201d Christina chuckles.<\/p>\n<p>You could call Christina many things: A transnational, an immigrant, <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/2013\/10\/18\/interview-tv-the-treasury-minister-and-third-culture-kids\/\">a third-culture kid<\/a>, a foreigner, a native, an expat. But none of these categories really fit given the fluidity of her upbringing and identity. We use labels to establish connections and try to make sense of things, but they can also dilute the intricacy and beauty of reality.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not 100% of anything,&#8221; is how Christina describes it. &#8220;Sometimes when people ask what I am, I just answer that I&#8217;m a human being.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Sophia Burton<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Photos provided by Christina and Sophia.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vienna.
