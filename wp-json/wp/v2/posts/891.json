New York Restaurant&#8221; was the second stop along <em>Erkundung im Paradies, <\/em>one of numerous tours offered by <a href=\"http:\/\/route44-neukoelln.de\/touren\/paradies_tour1.html\">Route 44<\/a> that explore Neuk\u00f6lln&#8217;s migration history and interculturalism. The tours are entirely female-run and designed by a group of diverse women who are proud to call Neuk\u00f6lln their &#8220;(second) home&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Neuk\u00f6lln is Berlin&#8217;s 8th district and home to 320,000 residents, approximately 40% of which are not ethnically German. Almost 150 nationalities are represented (primarily Turkey, the Arab world, and former Yugoslavia) and the district is at the heart of Berlin&#8217;s gentrification debate, making Neuk\u00f6lln hard to ignore. Nonetheless, it was off my radar for years and continues to be for tourists who either don&#8217;t know it exists or have been warned it&#8217;s too dangerous to visit.\u00a0My 250 page Berlin guide book from 2003 doesn&#8217;t say one word about Neuk\u00f6lln. Ten years later and it&#8217;s still not mentioned on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timeout.com\/berlin\/features\/10\/berlin-area-guide\">this list<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fodors.com\/news\/understanding-berlins-neighborhoods-5831.html\">this list<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityscouter.com\/travelguides\/berlin\/Berlin-Districts.html\">this list<\/a>. It is on <a href=\"http:\/\/berlin.cityseekr.com\/cityguide\/district-guide-1\">this one<\/a>: &#8220;More down-to-earth are the working-class districts of Wedding in the north and Neuk\u00f6lln in the south, which is sometimes referred to as the Berlin Bronx. Although they both have a reputation of being ghettos for the poor, unemployed and other down-and-outs, they are not as bad as they are made out to be.&#8221; What a ringing endorsement.<em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Route 44 girls describe\u00a0Neuk\u00f6lln as a region of &#8220;irritating problems but fascinating potential&#8221;. Unfortunately Neuk\u00f6lln&#8217;s problems go beyond irritating to downright serious: they have one of the city&#8217;s highest unemployment rates (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.berlin.de\/ba-neukoelln\/derbezirk\/arbeitslose.html\">17%<\/a>), high child poverty rates, and a crime rate that is about 40% higher than Berlin&#8217;s average. But it is also home to immense diversity, creativity, and rich cultural history. Reducing Neuk\u00f6lln (or any struggling region) to the &#8220;poor, unemployed and other down-and-outs&#8221; is not only unfair, it&#8217;s unproductive.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/2013-06-15-15-44-50.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/2013-06-15-15-44-50.jpg\" alt=\"2013-06-15 15.44.50\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><em>Erkundung im Paradies<\/em> or &#8220;Exploring Paradise&#8221; showcases this &#8220;fascinating potential&#8221; through an exploration of a neighborhood and its various houses of worship, educational institutions, trendy bars, and international restaurants. Yet perhaps the most interesting facet of the tour was not the stops itself, but the open dialogue it generated. The tour participants were largely locals and the intermittent chatter and questions culminated in a discussion on religion and the role of the headscarf. Hiba and Maria, our guides, responded openly and respectfully to questions from the group that ranged from\u00a0 &#8220;Aren&#8217;t women forced to wear them?&#8221; to &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wear one?&#8221; Hiba (Lebanese-German) and Maria (Pakistani-German) don&#8217;t wear headscarves and explained that while it&#8217;s a commitment they&#8217;re not ready to make now, they don&#8217;t rule it out for the future. Either way, it&#8217;s their choice alone.<\/p>\n<p>When asked by a\u00a0 journalist why they do the tours, they responded quite simply: &#8220;Neuk\u00f6lln has a bad reputation, and we want to change that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say the guidebooks should take note, but I&#8217;m not sure we need them. These women are creating their own and it&#8217;s a lot more interesting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>&#8211; By <strong>Sophia Burton<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>For more information on Route 44 tours, click <a href=\"http:\/\/route44-neukoelln.de\/touren.html\">here<\/a>.
