The goal of the campaign: the encouragement of colors-wearing, flag-toting, &#8216;Schland&#8217;-cheering citizens of the federal republic. One image made its way through German newspapers and magazines during this novel World Cup fever, representing what was now allowed, what could again be said without glancing over one&#8217;s shoulder &#8211; a 15-year old girl, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/spiegel\/print\/index-2014-29.html\">Monique Bienge<\/a>,\u00a0waving a scarf on which the German national anthem is printed, as pictured below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/spiegel\/print\/d-47282143.html\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2874 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/die-deutschland-party.jpg\" alt=\"Germany World Cup\" width=\"454\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/die-deutschland-party.jpg 454w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/die-deutschland-party-227x300.jpg 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The text on Monique&#8217;s scarf reads:<\/p>\n<p><em>Unity and justice and freedom<\/em><br \/>\n<em> for the German fatherland!<\/em><br \/>\n<em> To that let us aspire<\/em><br \/>\n<em> In a spirit of fraternity,<\/em><br \/>\n<em> With heart and soul.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So-called football nationalism is not limited\u00a0to one time of the year (or\u00a0to every four years, for that matter), however.

But this is Germany.\u00a0As the above extract from the German national anthem mentions, a fatherland is at stake here\u00a0&#8211; one that, at the time of\u00a0the anthem&#8217;s composition, did not exist.<\/p>\n<p>German-speaking public officials and intellectuals debated the question of identity and belonging during the years leading up to the creation of the federal conglomeration of\u00a0German states (out of the former Holy Roman Empire and environs). And in 1871, (mostly) peasants were absorbed into a territorial construction more or less controlled by Prussia (a state no longer in existence), all based on inklings of a so-called <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pan-Germanism\">Pan-Germanism<\/a>.\u00a0In other words,\u00a0<em>whose\u00a0<\/em>&#8216;fatherland&#8217; we are really talking about depends not only on\u00a0who you ask, but also on when this question is and has been posed in the past.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But what might this mean for the public exercise of patriotism?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The historically-rooted &#8216;German question&#8217;\u00a0&#8211; i.e.\u00a0who are the Germans? &#8211;\u00a0has yet to be completely solved. This is the point. How could it be? Countries, their populations, their mandates, their political philosophies of\u00a0law and justice, even their borders, are constantly changing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As <em>Der Spiegel&#8217;s<\/em>\u00a0&#8220;We Germans&#8221; cover demonstrates, the WC victory might\u00a0be an opportunity to\u00a0collectively re-work this\u00a0changing German identity, while it is still hot and malleable.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the outsider, all this hullabaloo in the face of three differently colored stripes might seem exaggerated, even just written off as a sign of unresolved historical traumata. But from a philosophical perspective, it is indeed productive to acknowledge all that patriotism implies, i.e.\u00a0what and whom it excludes. Such a topic is ever-relevant to the productive identity project that might\u00a0emerge from this World Cup victory&#8230; with the potential to re-create boundaries of belonging for the better.<\/p>\n<p>The cacophony of voices relating to Germanness and all that it encompasses has often been frustrating for German politicians, particularly in relation to defining citizenship laws. But rallies in the streets and public displays of &#8216;belonging to the German club&#8217; have somehow put these oft-exclusionary discussions on hold for a minute, giving journalists the chance to <a href=\"http:\/\/taz.de\/WM-und-Integration-in-Berlin\/!142407\/\">write about on-the-ground cohesion <\/a>or harmony in a country that often fosters a language of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spiegel.tv\/#\/filme\/duisburg-marxloh\/\">ghettoization<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2888\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/wm-berlin.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2888\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2888\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/wm-berlin.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"Photo by Juri Gottschau\" width=\"640\" height=\"401\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jurigottschau.com\/\">Juri Gottschau<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>That said, after the streets have cleared and the flags have been\u00a0taken down, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tagesspiegel.de\/meinung\/deutschland-ist-weltmeister-wm-traum-wm-trauma\/10207938.html\"><em>where does this leave the many immigrants or non-traditional members of German society<\/em>?<\/a> asked a columnist with immigration background, recently. For patriotism, like nationalism, thrives on exclusion. That is to say, a group is only a group if it has the capacity to actively determine who belongs and who does not. In essence, this is the definition of the modern state. Part of the state&#8217;s mandate is the ability to exercise force (as opposed to violence, according to Hannah Arendt), in order to maintain these boundaries, something rarely questioned in public discourse or by political constituencies.<\/p>\n<p>These\u00a0boundaries are not a given, however: they result from and are constantly reproduced in political processes,\u00a0 enshrined not only in law but in everyday institutions, ideologies, and practices of the outsiders vs. the insiders. This means that they\u00a0can be changed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In the end, this new German patriotism is only as good as the boundaries it is ready and able to redefine. An act of flowing colors and neighbor-to-neighbor high-fives may have started a new understanding of who is allowed into the club, but policies and institutions need to take it one step further. Otherwise, patriotism is just as good as nationalism &#8211; a political project and instrument\u00a0of the state\u00a0with the purpose of coercing\u00a0national conscription, labor-market participation, and civic legitimacy by way\u00a0of <em>exceptionalism<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0the type of\u00a0inclusive global society many of us would love to build, there is no room for exceptionalism.<\/p>\n<p>All big words and ideas aside, patriotism might have the chance to\u00a0be democratic and inclusive or it might become dangerously exclusive. As I have witnessed in my home country of the United States, this often depends on who sets the governmental agenda but also who shapes discussions as to what types of restrictions are legitimate, particularly in regards to labor-market and immigration policies.<\/p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be so top-down or even so economically-driven. We can decide who belongs to our club, and maybe, in an ideal world, politicians will respond.
