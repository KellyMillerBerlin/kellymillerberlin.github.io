And many of the &#8220;lessons&#8221; we receive are so subliminal and seemingly minor that they are dismissed as not warranting attention, let alone action. That or they go unnoticed altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Like when my German relatives and colleagues jokingly use the term <em>Negerk\u00fcsse<\/em> (N***** kisses) to describe marshmallow filled chocolates that went by this name in a former era. While younger Germans have been taught that the word <em>Neger*<\/em> is highly offensive, the term <em>Negerk\u00fcsse<\/em> has persevered and is still considered by many to be cute and funny.

And whose definition are we even using?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure which definition the folks at the Leiser shoe store chain are using, but it seems pretty antiquated to me. Their new marketing campaign, <em>Traumpaare<\/em> (dream pairs), packages pairs of shoes alongside &#8220;dreamy&#8221; couples, all of which are heterosexual and Aryan with &#8211; surprise! &#8211; blond, blue-eyed children.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/2013-04-11-09-35-05.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/2013-04-11-09-35-05.jpg\" alt=\"2013-04-11 09.35.05\" width=\"535\" height=\"402\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For kicks, I gave their\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.leiser.de\">website<\/a> a quick look to see if I was missing anything, but only found more of the same. It seems Leiser&#8217;s idea of diversity is a brunette. As far as skin pigment, facial features, and sexual orientation go, these advertisements do not stray very far from Nazi propaganda:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/aryan-family-neues-volk-1a8ezjw.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-521 aligncenter\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/aryan-family-neues-volk-1a8ezjw.jpg\" alt=\"aryan-family-neues-volk-1a8ezjw\" width=\"297\" height=\"414\" \/><\/a>Now, I&#8217;m not calling anyone at Leiser a Nazi any more than I&#8217;m saying that plastering a Turkish or Thai face on these posters will fix race relations. I&#8217;m sure Leiser wasn&#8217;t trying to be divisive with their poster campaign; in fact, I&#8217;m sure they didn&#8217;t think about it at all. And just like their creative process, the effect of these images will go largely unnoticed because they&#8217;re just storefront posters. They&#8217;re not a man screaming from a podium; they&#8217;re not even a racist comment muttered under someone&#8217;s breath on the subway. But they exist and they perpetuate a societal idea(l) of beauty and belonging that is outdated at best and exclusionary at worst.<\/p>\n<p>In the Berlin I know, &#8220;normal&#8221; is my apartment building filled half with German seniors and half with young families from Spain, Greece, and Poland. It&#8217;s a park full of Vietnamese- and Thai-German families selling <em>pad thai<\/em> and drinking Beck&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a subway ride at 4am after a friend&#8217;s party, sitting next to a couple Turks and across from a pair of transvestites.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Rather than be discriminatory, let&#8217;s become more discerning and increase our awareness of hurtful language and misrepresentative images. We could all stand to pay more attention to these (not so) little things in life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>&#8211; By <strong>Sophia Burton<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>*The term Neger is tricky to translate into English because of the socio-historical differences between Germany and the US that affect language around race. Officially, Neger translates to &#8220;nigger,&#8221; but the term has historically been used much more neutrally in Germany and is sometimes translated to &#8220;negro&#8221;. Today, the term Neger is widely regarded as offensive and campaigns exist to eradicate its use altogether. Accepted German terms for describing darker skinned individuals are &#8220;Afrodeutsch&#8221; (Afro-German) or &#8220;Schwarze(r)&#8221; (black). <\/em><\/p>\n<p><!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s these little images, phrases, and jokes that become so deeply engrained within our mindsets and pervasive within our culture that they are considered &#8220;normal&#8221;.
