For me, there is something ultimately gratifying, even safe, about\u00a0opening that jar of Adam&#8217;s peanut butter or letting the smell of buttermilk biscuits fill my Berlin apartment. At once, giving in to\u00a0&#8216;old urges&#8217; is washed\u00a0with self-realization.

Let&#8217;s call this the California Breakfast Slam effect.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/dsc01342.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2531 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/dsc01342.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"DSC01342\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Not all patrons of CABslam&#8217;s new digs are from the Western coast of the United States like myself, but there\u00a0certainly exists a clientele of the North American variety, motivated\u00a0more by feelings (or longings) than by taste, I dare to conjecture. Put simply,\u00a0who knew that a plate full of pancakes, browned potato shavings, bacon, and a fried egg would make one feel so secure? So &#8216;you&#8217; in your own maple-craving skin? This is the CABslam effect.<\/p>\n<p>Anthropologists would suggest that our food choices\u00a0constitute a large part of how we position ourselves in the world, particularly in a foreign context. In\u00a0a\u00a0country for which one possesses no legal or innate right to reside, one learns to miss\u00a0the general\u00a0social acceptance and security provided in\u00a0that <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/2013\/09\/16\/lens-going-away\/\">place\u00a0left behind<\/a>. Ethnographical studies* of immigrants around the world &#8211; Turkish immigrants vending kebap\u00a0to keep the nostalgic grill burning, taco trucks re-connecting small towns to distant landscapes, Punjabi import shops outlining\u00a0a community in the\u00a0anonymous\u00a0city &#8211; form\u00a0an extensive literature in support of this role of food as an identity-maker. Food ways, what and how we eat,\u00a0often serve to\u00a0reclaim a definition of self\u00a0that may be threatened by the indifferent surroundings of the foreign.<\/p>\n<p>Interesting to reflect upon, however, is how much of these positive associations are, in fact, related to the food itself. In other words, is it the constitution\u00a0and consistency of the yogurt\u00a0that reminds the Turkish immigrant of home (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/articles\/2013-01-31\/at-chobani-the-turkish-king-of-greek-yogurt\">the Chobani story<\/a>)? Is the sugar content of my peanut butter a key determinant of my sense of belonging &#8211; of how I affirm and embody my American identity in Germany?<\/p>\n<p>One of my father&#8217;s favorite activities, as of late, is going to the local mom &amp; pop diner located just around the corner from his home. He has always loved waffles, bacon, eggs &#8211; preferences I inherited, minus the bacon for environmental reasons (goodbye bacon bowls).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/img_20041.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2555 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/img_20041.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"IMG_2004\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>At this local breakfast spot\u00a0in Vancouver (WA), one sits in a cozy corner &#8211; on that particular kind of squeaky\u00a0upholstery reserved for diners &#8211; and receives bottom-less\u00a0coffee and a pint of the good, brown sticky stuff within moments of arriving, without needing to have asked. Luxury and simplicity come together in a routinized ritual that completes a Saturday morning.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/img_20051.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2556 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/img_20051.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"IMG_2005\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A visit to Neuk\u00f6lln&#8217;s diner-ish mock up, CABslam,\u00a0offers a similar experience, albeit with\u00a0wood in place of the traditional synthetic materials. The waitresses greet guests in English with a smile, a touch of accent on the tongue; plates of meat, starch, and sugar pass through the spacious, half-finished space, disturbed only by the squeal of espresso. Oh, American breakfast in Europe: such a strange delicacy, indeed.<\/p>\n<p>If I were to come upon a similar diner anywhere in the <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/2014\/01\/21\/beyond-berlin-difference-in-the-wet-country\/\">Pacific Northwest<\/a>, I would be confused by 1. the small portions, 2. the texture of the syrup, 3. the small portions, 4. the fancy coffee, and 5. the small portions. But while in that strange space of not always quite fitting in and not being quite sure how to amend the problem, one takes any moment of assured (if strangely assembled) belonging and identity one can get.<\/p>\n<p>And so I ordered French toast, Juri ordered the original California Breakfast Slam, and I ate his pancakes and felt thoroughly pleased with the entire situation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/dsc01335.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2524\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/dsc01335.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"DSC01335\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/dsc01335.jpg 433w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/dsc01335-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Glancing around the perhaps far-too spacious-to-be-cozy restaurant-in-progress, plates of beans and eggs (Huevos Rancheros!), \u00a0yellow sauce and bread (Eggs Benedict!), and hearty scrambles made it all just believable enough&#8230;even if it is not possible to get a side of\u00a0sweet &#8216;Amish bread&#8217;\u00a0here,\u00a0as is the case with my favorite diner in Seattle, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bethscafe.com\/index.php\">Beth&#8217;s Cafe<\/a>.

This does not mean that these foods\u00a0are objectively good or even at the top of my list. But this is not the point. Even though the mere idea of many American delights makes me a little uneasy and sad for the state of national nutrition (see &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.takepart.com\/place-at-the-table\">A Place at the Table<\/a>&#8221; for the full story), I delight just a little in being associated\u00a0with\u00a0such a cuisine. Because it is familiar and mine, in a way intimately intertwined with memory and what identity makes of it.<\/p>\n<p>More than anything else, the\u00a0moments at my childhood-dream-table, where chocolate-chip pancakes were the best reward and hash browns the coveted snack, are the things that bring\u00a0me the simplest of glee in a situation that is often colored by uncertainty.
