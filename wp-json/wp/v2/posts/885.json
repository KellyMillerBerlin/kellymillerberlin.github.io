Yet, any talk of Indian culture in public discourse seems to be reduced to curry and naan, in part because diversity may not always advertise itself with a sign saying &#8220;hey look at me, I&#8217;m different&#8221;. Encounters with difference are often unexpected and not necessarily representative of the cultural tropes we look for. <strong>If we only look for markers of diversity we are accustomed to, like a Little Bangladesh or a plenitude of South Asian groceries, we might be missing something<\/strong>. Sometimes, though,\u00a0recognizing diversity is\u00a0a combination of both: in this account, a seemingly average game of\u00a0cricket, spiced up by samosas and saris.\u00a0This a retelling of\u00a0experiencing everyday\u00a0<strong>real<\/strong><strong> Indians in Berlin, in real public space, in real time, and no, not in a restaurant.<\/strong> <\/em><\/p>\n<p>It is a hot and sticky Sunday night, the kind where every girl on the block looks a bit like a glistening Rosie Perez in Spike Lee\u2019s &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0097216\/\">Do the Right Thing<\/a>&#8220;. The scene of the street is one of pavement blurred by the heat that rises from a rolling black surface, a stream of hot that distorts the minarets and the treetops down the way. Butterflies of sweat decorate the backs of men waiting to cross the road, surprisingly still dressed in their shirts.\u00a0Large beads of sweat\u00a0form between my knuckles, on the skin beneath my wide metal bracelet, in the divet between lips and nostrils.<\/p>\n<p>The sound of wood hitting a ball \u2013 the kind of ball usually not found in these parts \u2013 meets the street. I cross the asphalt to the main entrance of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tempelhoferfreiheit.de\/\">Tempelhofer Feld<\/a>, the former airport of the Nazi air force now a recreational savannah in the district where I live. A sea of men in all white, standing in configurations familiar to other hot memories, can be seen meters away from my pace. The source of the sound: the batter\u2019s stance, the bowler\u2019s mound, colliding\u00a0in the awkward swing but swift contact of a cricket-bat.<\/p>\n<p>Tempelhof\u2019s baseball field is quite new; they have even added the hot dog stand as a prop to the Americana stage.\u00a0But on this day there are samosas and little boys in tunics, lingering in the outfield, practicing their swing.<\/p>\n<p><em>What game is this?<\/em> I ask, simply trying to strike up conversation with one of the youngsters, who curiously\u00a0nods in my direction, eyes peering bashfully at the strange gawking woman poking her glance through the gate. I stand with my hands on the metal cage surrounding the field like they do in the movies when visiting the neighborhood pitch. I remember when my dad dragged my sister and\u00a0me to neighborhood\u00a0baseball games when we lived in San Diego, when tailgate parties forever married the hot mirage of distance over asphalt to the sound of baseball and the consumption of snacks. Not just any snacks: quality peanuts for the traditional, oily garlic fries for the Seattleite Mariner. A good ol\u2019 hot mess. This mess has chutney or tamarind sauce as a side.<\/p>\n<p><em>It certainly isn&#8217;t baseball<\/em>, I add provocatively, though a large red sign with \u201cBaseball\u201d in white letters (and a picture to boot) hangs over the field precariously, as if to spell out the purpose of a caged patch of sand with strange bunker-like wings.<\/p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s called cricket<\/em>, the eldest boy tells me almost in a whisper, in passing. He looks back at his father. I smile, but &#8220;stranger-danger&#8221; still seems to have an effect, even when separated by a 6 meter-high metal cage. I wait.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/2013_06_21_14_16_55.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/2013_06_21_14_16_55.jpg\" alt=\"2013_06_21_14_16_55\" width=\"448\" height=\"335\" \/><\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>And who is playing?<\/em> I ask.\u00a0<em>India is playing,<\/em> he answers, then pauses.

A shrug and he teeters off, almost recognizing that his words might seem strange to me, a glance thrown back with a smirk. This conversation is in German; I definitely do not look like I could be from the same place as his parents, his skin the color of chestnuts, prominent against his all white-uniform. His father calls to him in a language neither German, English, or Hindi. He runs with the ball behind his back, sweat demarcating his narrow shoulder blades onto the back of an over sized white tunic to match his father\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>On the other edge of the fence women in saris, shorts, or tunics lean on strollers, lay in the grass, take photos or at least pretend to.

The little boy with whom I spoke puts his hand over his eyes to look for the round white rotation on the ground. The white-washed men scurry among the dust.<\/p>\n<p>Cricket is a low game, it seems, and so sweat ripples down from foreheads onto the earth.
