The folks at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slowtravelberlin.com\/\">Slow Travel Berlin<\/a> have put together a little piece on this culinary glorification of the chickpea, mapping its way through the different ethnic, religious, or just plain old neighborhood configurations that bring it to the table, particularly focusing on the Israeli-connection. An excerpt:\u00a0<i>\u201cFor Ze\u2019ev Avrahami, the owner of Sababa \u2013 Mama\u2019s Kitchen in Mitte, there was no place in Berlin that corresponded to his idea of hummus and he felt compelled to open his own shop. \u2018Hummus is not food,\u2019 this burly man with his permanent five o\u2019clock shadow tells me. \u2018It\u2019s a way of life. It\u2019s addictive \u2013 it\u2019s a drug. I eat hummus every day.\u2019 He too, has a mission: Apart from hummus with various toppings, Sababa\u2019s also serves a \u2018peace salad\u2019 made half of tomatoes, half of cucumbers and mint. \u2018Some say it\u2019s Arab, others say it\u2019s Israeli, half and half, green and red.\u2019\u201d<\/i> Click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slowtravelberlin.com\/2013\/04\/23\/from-azzam-to-zulas-hummus-in-berlin\/\">here<\/a> to read more from Anne Thomas\u2019s greatttt article about the activist side of Middle-Eastern flavors in Berlin\u2026<\/p>\n<p>On the thread of food, there is a delicious Sudanese Caf\u00e9 in three of Berlin&#8217;s districts called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nil-imbiss.de\/en\/index.html\">Nil<\/a>, which serves up street-food style plates of fava-bean falafel (Tamiya), fried bananas with peanut sauce, and delectable nutty soups with heaps of spice. If you stop by, be sure to chat a bit\u00a0with those working, who seem to enjoy recommending toppings or even rolling their eyes at the first request for <em>scharf<\/em> (spicy). Second time for the spice request is the charm, however, and they will be sure to make your pita\u00a0sandwich\u00a0a memorable one!\u00a0\u00a0Until you get a chance to visit in person or in spirit \u2013 depending on your location in the world \u2013 let this image\u00a0of US President Barack Obama and Nil united make you giggle just a little: <a href=\"http:\/\/whenyouliveinberlin.tumblr.com\/post\/48351042694\/tamiya-mit-hallumi-at-nil\">When You Live in Berlin<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>-By <strong>Kelly Miller<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy weekend, folks and happy art-watching, art-critiquing, art-consuming, if you find yourself in Berlin among the packed galleries from Neuk\u00f6lln to Friedenau (that\u2019s right, there is art to be found in the Berlin answer to the suburb, as well).
