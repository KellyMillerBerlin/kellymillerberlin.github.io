We were over three hours into the &#8220;German Identity and Identities in Germany&#8221; workshop, having already watched a documentary clip and listened to a panel discussion on the nuances of (im)migration, national identity, and belonging. Yet when asked by our facilitator <em>What is German?<\/em>, all we could come up with were stereotypes or nothing at all. I was in the latter camp, sitting quietly in the corner, scribbling down notes, the occasional eyebrow raise or eye roll gracing my face.\u00a0An older man on the other side of the room began criticizing globalization and everything &#8220;becoming the same&#8221;, proclaiming that when it comes down to it, identity is tied to region. <em>I have fire in my belly,<\/em> my friend whispered to me, leaning over. <em>So do I<\/em>, I thought, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with it. On some level our hybrid-identities felt under attack, as if our <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/2013\/09\/26\/lens-coming-home\/\">sense of home<\/a> tied to people, language, and experience was not as legitimate as one tied to geography.

For years I&#8217;d been navigating a slew of cultures, confidently code-switching, getting by and blending in pretty much anywhere with relative ease and advantage. Dual citizen, trilingual, well-traveled, ethnically ambiguous, international education professional, American-German-Jewish-Algerian mutt. I&#8217;d always felt <em>just different enough<\/em>, rather than <em>too different<\/em>. I&#8217;m a pretty ruthless cherry-picker, highlighting a particular part of my background when it suits the moment. <em>My dad&#8217;s Jewish and I went on Birthright<\/em>, I declare to Israeli airport security. <em>My mom&#8217;s German and I&#8217;m a dual citizen,<\/em> I respond when asked why I live in Berlin. <em>I&#8217;m part Algerian<\/em>, I say proudly to a cute Arab-German on a date. <em>I also grew up with two languages and have trouble with German<\/em>, I share with the Vietnamese girls I tutor. I&#8217;d positioned my international identity as the centerpiece of my life a long time ago, letting it guide me both personally and professionally. Perhaps it&#8217;s self-serving or even greedy, but it&#8217;s always felt like my choice.<\/p>\n<p>Others have their choice ripped from them with one ostensibly innocent question: &#8220;<strong>But where are you from from?&#8221; <\/strong><em><strong>Wo kommst du wirklich her? <\/strong><\/em>Translation: &#8220;You must come from somewhere other than here, because you look\/sound\/pray\/move\/eat\/celebrate differently than <em>we<\/em> do.&#8221; The plight of the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DWynJkN5HbQ\">perpetual foreigner<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>During my past two years in Berlin I&#8217;d started to get a little taste of what that felt like, an after-taste really. <em>No, I&#8217;m not Spanish<\/em>, I find myself saying at least once a week to those who wonder out-loud or even just start speaking to me in Spanish. I get it, there are an increasing number of Spaniards in Berlin (and Germany). I get it, I have darker features. But whereas I would normally enjoy talking about my background, I now find myself getting irritated and defensive having to explain myself against a recurrent assumption.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;People always ask how my German is so good.

For the first time in two years in Berlin, I not only wondered, but cared, whether the others in the room considered me German. Or even German enough.<\/p>\n<p><em>I grew up with German culture, speak the language, have the passport, and now live here<\/em>, I finally summoned up the courage and coherence to say. <em>But I&#8217;m only one fourth German &#8220;ethnically&#8221;.

A fluid and on-going process on both the individual and national level. Increased levels of migration and diversity often spark an instinct to distinguish, retreat, and protect- on both the &#8220;native&#8221; and &#8220;(im)migrant&#8221; sides. But it&#8217;s also an opportunity to reflect, learn, and reinvent.
