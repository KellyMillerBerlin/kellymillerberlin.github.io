Of course, not every Muslim fasts, not every faster is Muslim, and not all Muslims celebrate Ramadan the same (or even at all). But for those non-Muslims among us, Ramadan is an almost hidden spectacle with mysterious allure: the hot tea, the music, and the platters of food that only come out when the sun has turned in for the day or before it has even appeared. We hear the clatter of dishes from our neighbors\u2019 windows late into the night or watch\u00a0children\u00a0unpack colorful sweets on <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eid_ul-Fitr\"><i>Eid al-Fitr<\/i><\/a>, all without necessarily being able\u00a0to place these traditions in our own line of experience.\u00a0So, what is it actually like to break the fast at the end of the day among friends and family?

To me, it is not about &#8220;to each his or her own&#8221; or just about learning the majority language, rather it is about taking part in a two-way process. It is about getting to know one another and forging new spaces of neighborhood between these ways of knowing. It is often just about showing up to our neighbor\u2019s barbecue, about inviting the friendly guy from the <i>Sp\u00e4ti<\/i> to a party, about delivering mail to the lady upstairs (even if she never looks friendly) and staying in a slightly damp hallway to chit-chat (and not because you want to). I have learned from these experiences that it really is just about\u00a0going to places, interacting with others, and maybe asking questions. Taking an interest in the life and interests of one\u2019s neighbor is an integral part of what it means to live in a metropolis. Any other way forward and things might just fall apart.<\/p>\n<p>Ramadan is one way of holding everything together, keeping us honest in whether or not we really value difference \u2013 just like I really value pistachio cream and the Oud, maybe just as much as I value mayo on my fries or the American Diner. Such meet-your-neighbor events also give us reason to congregate and converse about all the things we do not know but might just assume about one another. Not everyone at this event\u00a0wore <em>hijab<\/em> or prayed with beads, not everyone fasted, not everyone was Muslim or even the same type of Muslim, for that matter.<\/p>\n<p>It should be of interest to all of\u00a0us that\u00a0nearly 7% of\u00a0Berlin&#8217;s population may be abstaining from food and water in 90 degree heat and 50% humidity, still going to work, driving cars, pushing strollers, running errands, participating in daily life during the holiest days in the Muslim religion. This phenomenon is happening all over the world, times ten, in many different shapes and flavors.<\/p>\n<p>The Kreuzberg Museum holds this event every year. We hope events like it will show up in places less expected than Kreuzberg, maybe even more situated in the everyday. We just have to show up and be a part of it.<\/p>\n<p><i>&#8211; By <b>Kelly Miller<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p>*<i>Integrationskurse<\/i> are federally mandated integration courses for immigrants and refugees within their first three years of residence in Germany.
