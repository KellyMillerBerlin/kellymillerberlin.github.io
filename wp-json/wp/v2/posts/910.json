I can attest to this fact, as a giant blues-soul-rock montage of musicians are performing &#8217;round the clock on a stage just a few meters from my window as part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bergmannstrassenfest-kreuzbergjazzt.de\/start.htm\">Bergmannstra\u00dfenfest<\/a>. As a loving member of the Kiez, I can tolerate loud tunes and folks my parents&#8217; age sitting on my stoop, drinking mojitos out of plastic cups and chatting loudly about drum-circle politics.

Considering that I came from Los Angeles and 25 degree weather, that was quite a feat. I decided quite spontaneously to move and 7 months later I landed in Tegel with 2 suitcases, a German-English dictionary and a lot of enthusiasm and naivet\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>What I love about Berlin is that there are still possibilities here as it is a city that is constantly in flux and reinventing itself and it allows me to change and grow with it. The Berlin I experienced 5 years ago when I first moved is quite a different place then the Berlin now and I suspect will be a new place again 5 years from today.<\/p>\n<p>Originally I came to Berlin to study opera with a teacher I had met in New York and a few years ago I was helping to run a fringe opera company &#8211; Berlin International Opera &#8211; while studying and working. Of course I&#8217;ve always loved cooking and entertaining but it wasn&#8217;t until a medical reason forced me to quit singing for a while and I needed a new outlet for my creative energy.<\/p>\n<p>One day I decided to wear one of my dirndls (I have a not so secret obsession with dirndls) and brought some kimchi to Mauerpark. I had a friend photograph people&#8217;s very fun reactions to eating kimchi for the first time and&#8230; voil\u00e0, &#8216;Fr\u00e4ulein Kimchi&#8217; was born. I got secretly obsessed with introducing Korean food to all those (poor) people who have had no experience with my native cuisine and whenever I travelled I always had a small package of Korean ingredients with me. (It&#8217;s the best way to get hosted on Couchsurfing if you offer to make people a home-cooked dinner!). I&#8217;ve cooked Korean food and made kimchi for people in Finland, Denmark, Norway, France, Austria, England, Ireland, Italy and of course all throughout Germany. In the meantime, back in Berlin I started teaching cooking classes at one of my favorite foodie stores &#8211; &#8216;Goldhahn &amp; Sampson&#8217; &#8211; and catering small parties and dinners for friends and acquaintances.<\/p>\n<p>What always surprises me about Berlin is how much it feels like a small town for being such a large city. I&#8217;ve been lucky in getting to know people through various circles that have really helped me along the way with developing my food passions. I got to know Kavita Meelu through mutual contacts at &#8216;Goldhahn &amp; Sampson&#8217; and cooked for one of her &#8216;Mother&#8217;s Mother&#8217; meals last summer, which then led me to &#8216;Kitchensurfing&#8217; which led me to &#8216;Street Food Thursday&#8217; at the Martkhalle 9, well, I guess I&#8217;ve been blessed with being in the right place at the right time with some amazing people to support me.<\/p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m keeping busy with &#8216;Street Food Thursdays&#8217;, my kimchi making and weekly catering at &#8216;Soundcloud&#8217;. I am surprised at how well everything is going, but I guess Berlin is finally ready for Korean-Fusion food and&#8230; Korean Tacos, which has been my passion from the start. It&#8217;s pretty funny, when I first approached the guys at &#8216;Goldhahn &amp; Sampson&#8217; to let me teach my Korean-Mexican class a few years ago, they were fairly resistant to the idea. &#8220;Lauren,&#8221; they said, &#8220;No one will know what that is, what IS a Korean taco?&#8221; I&#8217;m happy to say, I ended up finally convincing them and now I teach my Korean-Bavarian class there as well.<\/p>\n<p>In August I will be starting my own supperclub &#8211; &#8216;Fr\u00e4ulein Kimchi&#8217;s Delish Tisch&#8217;- in Prenzlauer Berg where I will offer seasonal menus with whimsical fusions between Korean, German and American food and I&#8217;m slowly, slowly toying with the idea of a &#8216;Fr\u00e4ulein Kimchi Caf\u00e9&#8217;&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em>For seat reservations to the &#8216;Delish Tisch&#8217; in August, please contact frauleinkimchi@gmail.com.
