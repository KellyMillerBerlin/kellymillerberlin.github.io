The debate takes many angles. There&#8217;s the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thelocal.de\/20131126\/germany-needs-more-immigration\">demographic argument<\/a>, that developed countries with low birth rates and aging populations need bodies to maintain the replacement rate. There&#8217;s the globalization take, that the movement of people in all forms is increasingly inevitable and contributes to global competitiveness and 21st century skills. The moral or even religious spin, emphasizing human dignity, charity, and an obligation for prosperous nations to help those more needy. Yet few arguments are as pervasive as the economic one: that immigrants fill labor shortages, tend to be more innovative, start businesses and create jobs, pay taxes, and contribute to the social welfare net (yes, often more than they &#8220;take away&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>It is this economic argument that is often relied upon as a point of mutual agreement that immigrants are needed. Maybe not <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dw.de\/opinion-foreigners-welcome-sort-of\/a-17651819\">\u201cwanted\u201d<\/a>, but at least needed.<\/p>\n<p>This argument extends beyond newcomers to the 2nd and 3rd generations. In countries like Germany where the history of immigration has been primarily low skilled, children of migrants still face numerous linguistic, cultural, and socioeconomic challenges. These are exacerbated by a stratified education system that is associated with lower educational attainment, limited access to higher education, and fewer chances for economic mobility. Germany fares particularly poorly in this arena: it has the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/general\/oecdeducationsystemsleavemanyimmigrantchildrenflounderingreportshows.htm\">OECD&#8217;s largest performance disparity<\/a> between native and immigrant students and is one of the only countries where 2nd generation students perform worse on international assessments than the 1st generation.<\/p>\n<p>Enter <em>Berlin braucht dich!<\/em> (Berlin needs you!), a program that works to improve the educational and economic outcomes of students with migrant backgrounds. Launched by the state of Berlin as part of its overall integration plan in 2006, it aims to increase the number of these students entering the public sector by 25% by bridging schools with the professional world. It is coordinated by BQN, <em>das Berufliche Qualifizierungsnetzwerk f\u00fcr Migrantinnen und Migranten in Berlin<\/em> (the Vocational Qualification Network for Immigrants in Berlin) and is funded by the state of Berlin.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Berlin braucht dich! - Diverse Wege in die Arbeitswelt\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fwBxQu93g3o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The program works in cycles: a day-long introduction to a business or organization for 7th graders, a week-long internship for 8th graders, 3-week internships for 9th graders, and training and application days for 10th graders. Participating schools help their students find training spots with an online matching tool. Spots are currently offered in Berlin&#8217;s public sector, public companies, and the metal and electrical industries, though BQN is working toward expanding the program to include small businesses. The program has also evolved from a focus on the vocational training system (<em>Duales System<\/em> &#8211; working and learning in a company) to more dual study opportunities <em>(Duales Studium<\/em> &#8211; studying and working simultaneously).<\/p>\n<p>Mitri Sirin, a German TV reporter of Turkish-Syrian background, moderates the 5th <em>Berlin braucht dich!<\/em> consortium meeting in June. He highlights the culture of low expectations and need for more varied training opportunities for migrant students during a panel on diversity politics.<em> The idea that any kid in the 7th grade would know what they wanted to be when they grow up is a fairy tale,<\/em> he scoffs. <em>Of course I was funneled into a vocational internship with other kids like me. I was still able to make something or other of myself<\/em>, he adds to chuckles from the audience,<em> but not all are so lucky.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2790\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/bbdconsortium.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2790\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2790 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/bbdconsortium.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"Berlin braucht dich!

It&#8217;s a bit eerie to be cloaked in darkness with pop music blaring before 11am, but soon enough the black-light theater performance has the audience tapping their feet and grinning widely.
