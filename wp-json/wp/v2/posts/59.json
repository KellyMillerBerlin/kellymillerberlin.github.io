They are socially-constructed, meaning they&#8217;re susceptible to social context and can differ depending on how one sees oneself vs. how one is seen by others.

My responding smirk, nod, and shrug were half-agreement and half-annoyance. While I am proud of my mixed background and international family, I also roll my eyes at the 3rd generation, self-proclaimed &#8220;Irish-American&#8221; whose only connection to the country is celebrating St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, or the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wetpaint.com\/jersey-shore\/articles\/is-the-jersey-shore-cast-really-italian\">Jersey Shore star claiming to be Italian<\/a>.

Rather than being Turkish-German, Germans with Turkish roots are often called <em>Deutscht\u00fcrken<\/em> (German-Turks). <strong>In this linguistic formation, German is modifying Turkish, and Turkish remains the defining attribute.<\/strong> Within everyday speak, the <em>Deutsch<\/em> is often dropped and they are simply called <em>T\u00fcrken<\/em>, even if they were born in Germany.

This is especially the case for the 2nd and 3rd generations, who are classified virtually no differently than newly arrived migrants despite having been born and grown up in Germany. It was also only a little more than a decade ago, in 2000, when Germany introduced a <em>jus soli<\/em> (birthplace) citizenship provision to allow children of migrants to apply for German citizenship. Thinking back to that German from earlier: I wonder if he&#8217;s thought about the fact that while many of those <em>mit Migrationshintergrund<\/em> would find being &#8220;just German&#8221; more than enough, they may never have the opportunity to.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8211; By <strong>Sophia Burton<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Migrants face the concept of identity more acutely than many other groups<\/strong>.
