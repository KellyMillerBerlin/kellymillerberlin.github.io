It&#8217;s probably a memorial to a citizen&#8217;s uprising or something, but I can&#8217;t help but think this is some sort of sick joke. The Germans can&#8217;t be <em>that<\/em> ignorant of their reputation when it comes to bureaucracy.<\/p>\n<p>A few good minutes trolling empty hallways on the wrong floor and I&#8217;ve found it. The first desk of three that I will encounter in the next 30 efficient minutes. Check-in, forms, wait. Rinse, repeat.

This midday excursion is my biggest event of the day. Less than 2 weeks in Berlin and I am nicely settled in my family&#8217;s apartment with a\u00a0printed letter from my <em>Opa <\/em>detailing our ownership tucked neatly into my German passport. My one-quarter of German blood is what makes all the difference between me and the squirming Middle Eastern looking couple hastily sorting their paperwork across from me. I carefully read over my single form, tripping over one or two questions that use the fancy German I didn&#8217;t grow up with.\u00a0<em>Welche\u00a0berufliche T\u00e4tigkeit \u00fcben Sie\u00a0aus? <\/em>instead of\u00a0<em>Was ist Ihr Job?\u00a0<\/em>I cluck my tongue angrily at a question asking my religion, resisting the temptation to write something snarky. I know it&#8217;s for tax purposes, but it pisses me off anyway. I leave it blank.<\/p>\n<p>My number flashes on the screen and I practically jump out of my seat, as if they&#8217;ll give up my spot within 30 seconds. The woman I&#8217;m assigned to is brusque but not unfriendly, and I try hard to speak my most proper German. It&#8217;s not like this mid-level bureaucrat has the power to take away my passport, but the irrational fear persists in the back of my mind.<\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s a bit confused by me and my occasional grammar mistake, but 5 or 6 stamps later and I&#8217;m free.\u00a0She uses a ruler to cleanly draw a line through &#8220;Bethesda&#8221; and replace it with &#8220;Berlin&#8221;.
