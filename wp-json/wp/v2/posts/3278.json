We have similar trajectories and political ponderings, though his roots lie far from mine in the American Deep South (here\u2019s a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.orionmagazine.org\/index.php\/place_where_you_live\/view\/chunky_mississippi_7753\/\">beautiful piece<\/a>\u00a0he wrote about his home in Mississippi). D\u00a0now lives\u00a0in East London, where the corner store owner greets you in an upbeat banter\u00a0and the sign to a \u2018Carolina Fried Chicken\u2019 joint dances in the light from the neighboring gastropub. Multicultural, maybe. But London\u2019s multiculturalism has a few faces and facades. And, in the end, it\u2019s the people that matter more than the cultural installation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3351 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg\" alt=\"img_1031-e1413145767969\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/img_1031-e1413145767969.jpg 640w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/img_1031-e1413145767969-300x199.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My first night in London, over pints at a very hip and haptic microbrewery \u2013 the tables grainy and splitting with moisture \u2013 D and I discuss our common struggles: We chat about how so-called experiences \u2018abroad\u2019 are, in the end, defined by labor market restrictions and the particular brand of our passport. Three years ago I would have insisted that these things are fluid. But even with a class degree from a class English university, a work allowance is hard to come by if not impossible in an academic job market already squeezed by its nationals, he shares. I can only nod, my plunge into the newest Berlin job search looming at the edge of my half-empty pint.<\/p>\n<p>Berlin, like London, is full of transplants, both temporary and permanent. Why so many? For the case of my friend D and me, why did we, in particular, take these leaps? Why do so many of our generation (and even those generations before us) move to cities in countries we have no\u00a0<i>de facto<\/i>\u00a0right to be in? Across the ocean,\u00a0<i>jus soli<\/i>,\u00a0<i>jus sanguinus<\/i>,\u00a0<i>jus<\/i>\u00a0whatever does, indeed, determine much of what is possible.<\/p>\n<p>The U.K, though London, in particular, invites dreams and dreamers. Multiculturalism results, in part, from the diversity of all those who believe in possibility; immigrants churn up new identities and make places we feel right to inhabit. In the case of Americans in London, maybe it\u2019s the common language, the similar sarcastic humor, or the attachment to butter-heavy things like pie and cookies, but it just makes sense to come here.<\/p>\n<p>In D\u2019s apartment, a short assemblage of brick and concrete in the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London_Borough_of_Hackney\">Hackney neighborhood<\/a>, I meet a few other fellow Americans. In many words, we all speak\u00a0of the hurdles one must leap (in stride) for the right to not only remain but to earn an income at that, to really participate in a place one might co-construct but for which legal rights are lacking. One of them, a\u00a0recent\u00a0graduate of the London School of Economics, is tirelessly working to bend a clause or make a rule that will allow him to stay. There is a sense of marathon-running in the air, trying and trying until you can\u2019t try anymore. Particularly palpable in a generation used to succeeding at most things, or told it is possible anyway.<\/p>\n<p>But sometimes, it just doesn\u2019t work out, at least temporarily, and many of those who come have to return to the places they left behind. But D seems optimistic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/dylan_3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3350 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/dylan_3-464x650.jpg\" alt=\"dylan_3\" width=\"464\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/dylan_3.jpg 464w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/dylan_3-214x300.jpg 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This matters because cities like London and Berlin actively foster the transplant spirit, but this doesn\u2019t mean that these places work to sustain it. According to recent research\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/books.google.de\/books?id=Cy7FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=%22migrants+or+expatriates+americans+in+europe%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bX6_r-fwO2&amp;sig=4Si_8b_0M8yuiU9Ti6hBkJ_Ijs8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M8IqVJW1IsbWPZzygOAN&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">on so-called American expatriates in Europe<\/a>, many transplants struggle for years at poorly paid jobs that are taken just to remain in the country. In Berlin, nearly half are underemployed and another third report contract-to-contract work (hustling, in other words). And yet, despite difficulties, many stay, which may be part financial, the\u00a0costs of rehabilitating a life somewhere else, for example, and part mythical, i.e. what it means to constantly imagine future potential, then find it too difficult to forgo what might have been.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, staying has a lot to do with the appearance of things. For how\u00a0much of the transplant culture results from what one sees or experiences upon arriving, regardless of the actual rules of the game, even\u00a0in spite of real barriers to inclusion? Put simply, if I see other Americans making it, or just a plethora of other nationalities making it, is it wrong to think\u00a0I\u2019ll make it?<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the particular brand of passport produces a variety of experiences, but very few of us have a free-pass (excluding what D jokingly refers to as \u2018fake Americans\u2019 in London who legally remain in the country under an inherited European passport). Now,\u00a0sitting in D\u2019s kitchen with a liter\u00a0of freshly brewed coffee (not tea), he tells me another story, one of a good friend\u2019s predicament \u2013 an EU citizen, married to a Mexican national. In short, the immigration authorities of the U.K. have decided that the couple\u00a0fails to meet requirements for residency in London, he tells me. Mexico is a country not seen favorably for transplantation; a hierarchy of acceptable migrants certainly does exist. But this all feels strangely hypothetical \u2013 this game of planning a life beyond borders, making moves and readying oneself for the counter. It is a lesson in rectifying\u00a0a roster of rules with a vibrant diversity suggestive of\u00a0more flexibility, more fluidity, than might be the case.<\/p>\n<p>We leave the apartment\u00a0and its conversation for a walk. Outside, it\u2019s humid but pleasant, and\u00a0the streets of D\u2019s neighborhood are\u00a0bursting with an\u00a0eclecticism even beyond what the\u00a0NY Times\u00a0recently featured in \u2018<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/04\/29\/travel\/36-hours-in-east-london.html\">36 hours in East London<\/a>\u2018 (as if the region needed its own holiday, apart from the financial men and women in suits of central London or the manicured streets of the West). Here, social housing projects tower above\u00a0quaint town homes, neighbors trimming their\u00a0rose bushes, bass piling out of a high window onto a long set of shears. Just down the road, one of London\u2019s most bubbling food\u00a0bazaars\u00a0\u2013 a foodie\u2019s\u00a0scene of cultural consumption \u2013 is in full swing. Broadway Market: where German sausages, and meat pies, and lox bagels, and Persian\u00a0kebab, and samosas, and ramen-to-go find frequent (young) patrons. We both\u00a0delight in the anything-but-discordant multilingualism this variety yields.<\/p>\n<p>In a pod of food carts just blocks from the market\u2019s main drag, I find the best burrito I\u2019ve had outside of the Western United States \u2013 a man with an air of L.A. dishing up marinated legumes, sauces streaming out of all sides of the tortilla like a blessing. A neighboring kiosk\u00a0serves up what they call Filipino wraps (pork belly, assorted greens, tangy sauce), D\u2019s favorite. As I walk to peruse other flavors,\u00a0D shares his visa predicament with\u00a0the owner of the wraps, explaining that this sandwich will be his last after a year of patronage. The owner\u00a0offers to sponsor his visa, chuckling but serious, D tells me. Maybe he should take him up on his offer we joke, meaning it. D smiles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/pork-belly.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3349\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/pork-belly-488x650.jpg\" alt=\"pork-belly\" width=\"400\" height=\"532\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/pork-belly-488x650.jpg 488w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/pork-belly-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/pork-belly.jpg 489w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to feel welcomed here.<\/p>\n<p>Far away from East London, I find myself in the kitchen of a German transplant on the ground floor of an elderly but charming home in a neighborhood near Kensington. \u00a0From my luggage I unload mustard I\u2019ve carted across the channel, tubes I was almost not allowed to take onto the plane.\u00a0<i>You just can\u2019t find this here<\/i>, my host says, that certain spicy mustard.<\/p>\n<p>Her\u00a0friends are all from somewhere else, she shares,\u00a0<i>but the problem with transplants is that they all leave eventually, and then, all of a sudden, you don\u2019t have any friends<\/i>.

Brick Lane, a curated experience of all that London attracts, the object of film, book, and tourism, is the sharpened edge of the city\u2019s sale of eclecticism. It is a blend of curry houses and backdoor sweets shops for tourists and locals alike; it is the contrast between\u00a0posh chocolatiers and wholesale textile vendors or between\u00a0grunge coffee houses and chic boutiques. But it is not what is seen here that inspires but what is implied: that this \u2013 reproduction of home, community-making in memory \u2013 is possible. Even if it always isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>After another burrito, this time seasoned with garam masala, we chat with an artist crafting overt social commentary, something he calls \u2018the Prejudice Project\u2019. With a long beard and dark eyes, he has likely faced that which his project targets. His bright smile opens up to pure optimism as we discuss diversity politics, however. But things can be difficult, indeed:\u00a0In London, it\u2019s not as free as in Berlin, he shares, a place he once inhabited, squatting in K\u00f6penick and composing works\u00a0that now hang in this design outlet just off Brick Lane.\u00a0<i>The folks here are different<\/i>, he says, pausing, belonging to a\u00a0<i>certain type<\/i>. He gives me a postcard,\u00a0<i>a token to remember our conversation<\/i>: \u2018#Paradise\u2019 printed on a white surface, a glimpse of blue sky in the background.<\/p>\n<p>D is moving back to the United States. After a preliminary job search and the weight of a different kind of bureaucracy on his shoulders, it seems like the best thing, for now. As he\u00a0prepares for his departure to Philadelphia he looks mournful, visiting his favorite food carts and bookshop, the dingy canal with folks living out of boats \u2013 the air thick\u00a0with\u00a0oil and wet brush \u2013 before it all becomes just another place where he once lived.\u00a0<i>I\u2019d like to come back<\/i>, he says,\u00a0<i>but then I just walk around and look at all the people here and want to go up and ask \u2018like, how do you live here? What do you do?\u2019<\/i> Perhaps, many of them are themselves transplants, just figuring it out as they go, leaving eventually for another place.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to say, given the look of things.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/img_1035.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3348 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/img_1035.jpg\" alt=\"img_1035\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/img_1035.jpg 640w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/img_1035-300x138.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <i>By <strong>Kelly Miller<\/strong><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>For more background on\u00a0London as a city of immigration check out this 2013 <\/i> Times<i>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/tto\/public\/postcard\/article3757989.ece\">article<\/a>, which provides a concise run-down on the\u00a0various groups and waves that make up London\u2019s diversity.
