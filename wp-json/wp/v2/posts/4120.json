With the current refugee and migrant crisis, old tensions are slowly and loudly being unearthed.

The volume documents\u00a0a massive and relentless deportation program at a time when xenophobia and economic distress were rampant. Historians Raymond Rodriguez and Francisco Balderrama document what is nothing short of a terrifying\u00a0episode in American history \u2013 frightening for what right-wing reactionaries in a new age of migration might be capable of.<\/p>\n<p>As Rodriguez shared with <em>Fresh Air<\/em>\u2019s host, Terry Gross, the 1930s treated Mexican Americans with great malice and abuse. For reason only of their heritage, they were targeted\u00a0by government programs and private citizens alike. This abuse culminated in the federal government&#8217;s campaign to strip millions of Americans of their citizenship. Not all those rounded up in deportation raids were naturalized citizens, though <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/codeswitch\/2015\/09\/08\/437579834\/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\">estimates suggest than \u00bd of those expelled were<\/a>.\u00a0Most\u00a0were visa-holders of some sort, their only crime having been born a member of a demonized ethnic group.<\/p>\n<p>Governmental programs to\u00a0round up and expel society\u2019s undesirables often begin in cities, according to history (see the American strategy of Japanese internment or Nazi Germany&#8217;s institution of the urban ghetto). And so Los Angeles was the primary target of the government\u2019s Mexican American deportation program. Largely as a response to\u00a0the despair the Great Depression had unleashed across the country, officials systematically sent entire families from the L.A. area back to Mexico, with no infrastructure in place to receive them. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/codeswitch\/2015\/09\/08\/437579834\/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\">From 1929 to 1944, 1\/3 of L.A.\u2019s Mexican American population was deported<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4128\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Los-Angeles-Public-Library-Herald-Examiner-Collection-1932.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4128\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4128\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Los-Angeles-Public-Library-Herald-Examiner-Collection-1932-650x487.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles Mexican Americans 1932\" width=\"650\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Los-Angeles-Public-Library-Herald-Examiner-Collection-1932-650x487.jpg 650w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Los-Angeles-Public-Library-Herald-Examiner-Collection-1932-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Los-Angeles-Public-Library-Herald-Examiner-Collection-1932-80x60.jpg 80w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Los-Angeles-Public-Library-Herald-Examiner-Collection-1932.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-4128\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Los Angeles Public Library\/Herald Examiner Collection via <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/codeswitch\/2015\/09\/08\/437579834\/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\">National Public Radio<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/div>\n<p><em>Ressentiments<\/em> \u2013 projection of resentment or fear onto often vulnerable\u00a0groups in society\u00a0\u2013 were widespread both in the U.S. and in Germany throughout the Great Depression. Xenophobia in the face of severe economic collapse paved the way for Germany\u2019s organized extermination machinery. The U.S.\u2019s internment of Japanese and German citizens, its continued subordination of Black Americans, and its systematic deportation of Mexican Americans demonstrate that this country was in no way spared such a nasty past.<\/p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, such <em>ressentiments<\/em> have now begun to return.

Because\u00a0the northern bank of the river\u00a0offers families more space for cheaper, better funded schools for fewer private tax dollars, and income tax exemption, immigrants who may have otherwise moved to the Portland, Oregon metro area are now planting themselves on the side of its less expensive neighbor.

We can expect this number to be much higher in reality,\u00a0as immigrants will often opt out of\u00a0participation in the census. There are other ethnic groups represented in Vancouver\u2019s demographic development: For example, 18% of families speak a language other than English at home, and the traditional taco truck has recently seen competition in North African, Japanese, and Thai flavors.<\/p>\n<p>None of this would seem all that significant, if I were not writing about a traditionally conservative county, with once sprawling farm land and a historical military base; a county that has now been converted into a rare blend of suburban developments, strip malls, urbane boutiques, and miles and miles of regional road. The nickname of &#8220;Van-tucky&#8221;* &#8211; something I have only heard used on the other side of the water, mind you &#8211; might tell you all you need to know.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0rate of poverty in Vancouver is also higher than the national average. Vancouver&#8217;s mayor recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofvancouver.us\/ced\/page\/affordable-housing-task-force\">launched a task force<\/a> to investigate the cause of growing homelessness, rising rents, and increased demand for housing in the city\u2019s most accessible and commercially viable areas.

Three White bikers &#8211; two older women with smokers&#8217; cough and one machismo with a mustache &#8211; scoff at the price of their beer.

With President Obama\u2019s pledge to take in 100,000 refugees, the question becomes \u201cHow will this country prepare its citizens to engage respectfully and kindly with members of a majority Muslim country?\u201d The first step in this process is realizing that we have a lot of work to do, and we need politicians who will help us get there.<\/p>\n<p>Germany has seen a fair share of reporting on the readiness of its population to open its arms to newcomers. It is easy\u00a0to draw parallels to the past, particularly to Germany\u2019s track record in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2015\/09\/20\/441732811\/in-germany-migrants-find-footing-but-also-some-resistance\">failing to integrate its guest-worker population and in promoting ethnic-based citizenship until it was almost too late<\/a>. However, it is Germany the rest of the world now\u00a0looks to in awe &#8211; for choosing a kind of <em>moralpolitik<\/em> over patterns of the past.<\/p>\n<p>Being so far away from a society I sometimes feel I know more about than my own (society of origin), I can\u2019t help but beam with pride in watching small towns across Germany\u00a0distribute clean clothes, socks, new toys, children\u2019s books, and warm meals to the thousands of human beings in need who have crossed their borders.\u00a0Nevertheless, Germany has since\u00a0issued temporary border controls. Order still wins out over populist charity.<\/p>\n<p>But aiming for a collective solution to the continuous stream of migrants and refugees into Europe, German leaders have worked to\u00a0reach agreement upon a\u00a0refugee quota for EU member states. Just this Tuesday this quota became a provisional reality.<\/p>\n<p>Time will tell if all members comply, and if a sense of moral duty is really as strong as images of kind citizens touting bags of donations suggest. Yet\u00a0I do have the sense that with each step toward welcoming the Other,\u00a0<em>ressentiments<\/em> have fewer chances of surviving.\u00a0When demonstrations of kindness are just so strong, so publicly undeniable, that Trump-esque hate can find no oxygen for its fire.<\/p>\n<p>That is what I hope for America.<\/p>\n<p>At the moment, the U.S. remains crippled and complicated by its multi-layered fears of all the regions of the world it has wronged. As UN Ambassador <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2015\/09\/23\/442761552\/10-000-syrian-refugees-just-the-floor-of-u-s-effort-says-ambassador-power\">Samantha Power made clear in an NPR interview recently<\/a>, the country is not ready to simply do the right thing; it has to be a calculated response, taking security into account.<\/p>\n<p>Overcoming fear is America&#8217;s consistent and stubborn challenge.
