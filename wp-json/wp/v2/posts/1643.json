The &#8216;Turkish factor&#8217;, regardless of how it came to be, makes Berlin, and Germany for that matter, the place we know.\u00a0Without it, students would miss their late night meaty snack in the likes of D\u00f6ner, the skyline would miss many of its stunning minarets, and the census would be sorely missing the strength of difference (just to name a few).<\/p>\n<p>But being Turkish, German-Turkish, or Turkish-German in Berlin are states of being <a title=\"Over and\u00a0Over\" href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/2013\/04\/23\/over-and-over\/\">without a formula<\/a>.

And that is just what we (me and my German companion, Juri) did just a few weeks ago.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 in Istanbul: Stammtisch<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Upon our arrival into Istanbul&#8217;s (proudly named) Ataturk airport, we were led like lost sheep into the belly of a beast, i.e. Turkey&#8217;s passport control. All around us the air buzzed in German, repeating the ritual of my everyday commute on the metro, this time with the confusion and frustration of a forced queue in a city far away from German-land. A mustached man holding a sign for <em>Studenten der Humboldt Universit\u00e4t<\/em>\u00a0(students of Berlin&#8217;s Humboldt University) stood on the other side of the human barrier, shifting his weight methodically.

Within seconds of walking through quaint double doors, we could hear &#8211; once again &#8211; the language of my daily commute. A young German woman chatted enthusiastically with her father, a yellow Reclam paperback of some German classic in her hand. Her father peered over his narrow reading glasses, raising his eyes just to hit the inventory at the back of the store &#8211; stacks of imported magazines and newspapers, including the kitschy tabloids older women with orange hair read at the bus stops in Berlin.<\/p>\n<p>I wandered to the western edge of the dimly lit shop, discovering 20 ft. high shelves of children&#8217;s books in German.
