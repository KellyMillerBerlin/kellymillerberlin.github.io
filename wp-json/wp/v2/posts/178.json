Saturday Night Live? World War II? Either way, I&#8217;m pleased to have gotten your attention. Let&#8217;s talk about Jew in a Box.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Jew in a Box is a nickname for what the Jewish Museum in Berlin is calling <em>Die ganze Wahrheit<\/em>, or The Whole Truth: a special exhibit that teaches Germans about real-life Jews, to put it bluntly. For two hours a day, a Jewish volunteer sits in a box and answers questions from museum-goers about all things Jewish. Any topic is free game, from God to\u00a0Netanyahu to pork to circumcision.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A half-Jew myself, I really want to like this exhibit. And I do in many ways. I believe that direct exposure to &#8220;others&#8221; can help break down barriers and generate understanding between groups. <strong>It often just takes meeting one person to humanize an entire group and start to break down harmful stereotypes.<\/strong> And a forum for being open and where there are no stupid questions, well let&#8217;s just say I often wish life were like that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I also appreciate the focus on the<em> current<\/em> experience of Jews in Germany. Germany does a whole lot to acknowledge the past, but the fact remains that <strong>most Germans today don&#8217;t have regular contact with Jews and know little about their religion and culture.<\/strong> Or maybe they do, and just don&#8217;t know it. Many would likely be surprised to learn that Berlin has a thriving &#8211; and growing &#8211; population of young Israelis and Jews.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/indepth\/features\/2013\/02\/201322711114892470.html\">Experts put estimates at up to 30,000<\/a>, maybe even higher since many Israelis have European passports and <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/2013\/04\/23\/over-and-over\/\">aren&#8217;t considered immigrants<\/a>. Of course that doesn&#8217;t come close to the half a million Jews who lived in pre-war Germany, but it&#8217;s still considerable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Negative reactions to the exhibit span from calling it &#8220;distasteful&#8221; to &#8220;degradation of the Jew.&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t go as far to say the latter, but can understand a bit of the former. I see how the &#8220;box&#8221; analogy would make one uneasy. There&#8217;s also a fine line between being open and disrespectful, and with no filters and provocative signs surrounding the exhibit with statements like &#8220;The Jews are guilty of everything,&#8221; there&#8217;s potential for things to get offensive. But probably the biggest problem with this exhibit is that it&#8217;s somewhat reductionist. The Jews are more than a religious group- they are a diaspora, and a diverse one at that. An Orthodox Jew living in Brooklyn and a Jew from Ethiopia living as a Christian to escape persecution have less in common than I do with Oprah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Can any one Jew really give &#8220;the whole truth&#8221;?
