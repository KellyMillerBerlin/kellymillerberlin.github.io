What is important? The answers to these questions\u00a0are not as simple as\u00a0good bread\u00a0or Hefeweizen. Expats with an outsider perspective are not shy in constructing simple\u00a0&#8216;Germanness&#8217; for the Germans themselves. The BBC reality TV series &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/tv-and-radio\/2013\/aug\/07\/make-me-german-tv-review\">Make Me a German<\/a>&#8221; plays with stereotypes and assumptions about what is <em>typisch deutsch<\/em> (typically German); the viral blog post\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.uberlin.co.uk\/what-i-know-about-germans\/\"><em>What I know about Germans <\/em><\/a>is just one example of trendy list-making of all things &#8216;German&#8217; by temporary residents; Berlin-based comedy writer <a href=\"http:\/\/adam-fletcher.co.uk\/\">Adam Fletcher<\/a> has created an entire <a href=\"http:\/\/store.hipstery.com\/\">brand<\/a> just based on the funny categorization of \u2018Germanness\u2019.

Two Taiwanese students, an American-Spanish couple on vacation from their residence in Saudi Arabia, a Brazilian student traveling Europe for the first time, a Bulgarian engineer, and Max and I (both Americans).\u00a0We met our guide Alex, exchanged small talk, in part to find out why we all were willing to commit seven hours on a Sunday to hearing about tragedy, visiting the haunted, vast expanses of Sachsenhausen &#8211; a concentration camp just right on the edge of Berlin, reachable with the S-Bahn (public transit).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In contemporary political discussions about integration of immigrants into \u2018German society\u2019, no one claims that integration requires learning the lessons of the Holocaust. And yet, federal integration programs combined with international perception of Germanness say just that.\u00a0The public concept of historical memorialization and its application, called\u00a0<em>Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung, <\/em>is just as important to living in German society as <em>v<\/em><em>ollkorn Br\u00f6tchen <\/em>or <em>Oktoberfest. <\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On our tour&#8217;s long walk\u00a0from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.oranienburg.de\/texte\/seite.php?id=91511\">Oranienburg<\/a>\u00a0station to the gates of the camp, passing average-looking &#8216;German&#8217; homes with gardens neatly segregated from the street by high fences, I spoke with Natalia (the student from S\u00e3o Paulo) about Germany, the Germans, and the Holocaust. She brought up an interesting point: \u201cHow do the Germans feel about it &#8211; that people go to Venice to see the canals and to Berlin to see the Holocaust? I can imagine they don\u2019t like it\u201d. A man jogged past us in bright running-gear, his dog trotting behind him, just passing the entrance to the camp. This is part of being German &#8211; accepting that this is how you are seen in the world, that this history is an indivisible part of any sense of being German, it seemed.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_130218225935786183.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1363\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_130218225935786183.png?w=640\" alt=\"Aviary Photo_130218225935786183\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For new residents of Berlin, the past still matters and maybe even more than integration programs can provide for. My Ukrainian-American-Jewish friend Max (gotta love them\u00a0hyphens) and\u00a0his family left\u00a0Kiev\u00a0when he was five,\u00a0in part\u00a0due to Antisemitism. His great-great-grandparents were killed in the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babi_Yar\">Babi Yar massacre<\/a>\u00a0of 1941. The precarious relationship of the German government to its new status as an immigration country, let alone the way it classifies its non-German residents, is very much familiar to Max. &#8220;So, how does that make you feel as a Jew in Germany?&#8221;, I asked a bit sheepishly, recognizing the change of context from friendly chatter we usually entertain to rrrrrreal real fast. Many Jewish immigrants to Germany have likely heard this question before. \u201cAntisemitism is more the exception than the rule. I don\u2019t feel confronted by it in daily life&#8230;but I know it\u2019s there\u201d, he concluded. He is supportive of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anti-Fascist_Action\">Antifa<\/a> movements, aware that being Jewish in Germany is complicated but totally do-able, requiring a little finesse. Berlin, of course, has all kinds of finesse.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our tour entered Sachsenhausen through the renovated watchtower and its metal gates, a\u00a0construction\u00a0bearing the\u00a0architectural legacy of the post-war custodians of the camp and many others &#8211; the (East) German Democratic Republic.\u00a0A stream of\u00a0other visitors followed our trail, audio devices pressed to their ears. I felt strange, almost supportive of an odd form of tourism, securing\u00a0Natalia&#8217;s comment about the connection of Holocaust tourism to German identity in reality.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3419\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_1302182256975699431.png\" alt=\"aviary-photo_130218225697569943\" width=\"606\" height=\"606\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_1302182256975699431.png 606w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_1302182256975699431-300x300.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A cacophony of languages could be heard as we moved from one monument within the camp to another &#8211; Swedish, Japanese, British English, French &#8211; all reading the same saddening information on plaques or biographical exhibition panels, all bearing witness to tragedy and an integral part (if not the deciding event) of\u00a0this country&#8217;s\u00a0history and present.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We moved to the far edge of the camp,\u00a0heading toward\u00a0the restored\u00a0Barrack 38: the Jewish barrack turned memorial documentation center. As we entered the small structure,\u00a0the smell of charred wood was unmistakable, paint peeling from the siding of the latrine and sleeping porch. Arson. In 1992, German identity was thrust under\u00a0international limelight after reunification and the growing pains that followed, further exacerbated by the rise of Neonazism in the former East. Arson was a key expression of this tension. This same year of the attack on Barrack 38, Neonazis set fire to a refugee housing facility not too far from Berlin, terrorizing residents\u00a0in the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Riot_of_Rostock-Lichtenhagen\">riot of Rostock-Lichtenhagen<\/a>. The political activities of parties and movements, such as the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Democratic_Party_of_Germany\">NPD<\/a>\u00a0(German Nationalist Party with strong Neonazi ties), as well as\u00a0the recent\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/international\/topic\/national_socialist_underground\/\">Neonazi terror-cell<\/a>\u00a0and its string of xenophobic murders across Germany, point to a\u00a0 contemporary relevance of the Nazi past to Germany\u2019s future as a country of immigration.

As our guide Alex\u00a0(speaking a high variety of the King&#8217;s English) began to share an illustrative vignette about the end of the war and deterioration of Nazi moral power in Germany, passengers in the train appeared perturbed. A woman with fiery hair shook her head in disgust; she\u00a0furled insults in German in our guide&#8217;s direction (understood only by me at the time). Another stern-faced\u00a0German woman entered shortly after, raising her voice to replace that of the recently exited red-haired woman.\u00a0Her lips quivering, she looked to be my mother\u2019s age, the veins in her neck traumatically flinching, exposed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stop talking. It is rude what you are doing. It is not right what you are doing. We don\u2019t need to be lectured to! You must stop&#8221;, she said abruptly in English.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">German trains and buses are anything but loud, each keeping to his or herself in a very strong show of privacy. This may be a stereotype, but it illuminates the particular conflict that ensued quite well.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With eyes closed in shock, our guide explained that we were on an educational tour\u00a0of the concentration camp, that he had been doing this for years and had never had such a negative reaction. He kept calm and showed no sign of anger or distress. The female companion of the pulsing-veined woman responded loudly with perhaps the only words she knew: &#8220;shut uppp!&#8221;, popping the &#8216;p&#8217; just at the end.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My friend Max intervened &#8211; asked our guide to have a seat, standing to allow him to do so. With hands shaking and eyes kept\u00a0closed, Alex continued his narrative: the time after the war, the protests of 1968, de-Nazification in educational and political institutions, current movements of young people, general\u00a0skepticism toward patriotism in Germany ever since &#8211; all forming parts of a whole history that has never really come to a close.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we exited the train, the pulsing-veined woman\u00a0ran to Alex, extending her hand to graze his:\u00a0&#8220;I agree with everything you said!&#8221;, she said, &#8220;but you were just speaking so loud for a public place! It is a train, not a classroom. Your voice was really just too loud for all of us, so for next time, just speak quieter.&#8221; She paused, Alex thanked her.\u00a0And then with one last quiver of the\u00a0lip: &#8220;I was one of those Germans you talked about, one of those students with guilt for something I wasn&#8217;t even old enough to have participated in. So thank you for what you said&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;I don\u2019t want anyone thinking \u2018oh these horrible Germans\u2019. I don\u2019t want you all leaving thinking that,&#8221; the woman\u00a0added as we had nearly\u00a0let the train doors\u00a0shut behind us, her eyes directed at all of us in a show of penetrating honesty. Education about the past does more than just memorialize or prevent reoccurrence: it avoids essentialization of historical events and preserves the complexity of it all.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3421\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_130218226704073063-650x487.png\" alt=\"aviary-photo_130218226704073063\" width=\"650\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_130218226704073063-650x487.png 650w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_130218226704073063-300x225.png 300w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_130218226704073063-80x60.png 80w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/aviary-photo_130218226704073063.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the new immigration status of 2005 and the integration programs that followed, came the creation of an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bamf.de\/EN\/Willkommen\/DeutschLernen\/Integrationskurse\/InhaltAblauf\/inhaltablauf-node.html\">&#8216;integration curriculum&#8217;<\/a>, including cultural orientation that included this very facet of Germanness: the Holocaust. Immigrants participating in the <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/2013\/06\/18\/review-become-a-german\/\">integration courses <\/a>visit historical institutions designed to communicate the significance of the Nazi period for Germany as both a modern state and as a\u00a0group of transnational or transethnic individuals.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Official curriculum including Holocaust field-trips doesn&#8217;t answer all questions, however. Politicians are still scratching their heads at the &#8216;German question&#8217;\u00a0&#8211; each party choosing which elements it wants to claim for the imagined &#8216;nation&#8217;, some\u00a0famously campaigning for a <em>Leitkultur\u00a0(<\/em>one central guiding culture for Germany by Germans).\u00a0Such a sentiment\u00a0has been\u00a0heavily criticized by most politicians outside of the leading conservative party (CDU), including the head of the Jewish Council of Germany, Paul Spiegel. In a speech to Parliament, Spiegel said\u00a0<em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.berliner-zeitung.de\/archiv\/leitkultur---die-scharfe-kritik-von-paul-spiegel-am--verbalen-zuendeln-der-politiker--hat-die-union-aufgeschreckt--der-bundesrat-stimmte-dem-antrag-auf-ein-verbot-der-rechtsextremen-npd-zu--merz-versuchte-zu-intervenieren,10810590,9851008.html\">&#8220;Ist es etwa deutsche Leitkultur, Fremde zu jagen, Synagogen anzuz\u00fcnden, Obdachlose zu t\u00f6ten?&#8221;<\/a>, &#8220;is it &#8216;German culture&#8217; to hunt down foreigners, to light synagogues on fire, to kill the homeless<\/em>?&#8221; The Holocaust is not far from these debates about Germanness, thus it is no wonder that it is included at least in educational programs to include newcomers in German society.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today&#8217;s Germany &#8211; an immigration country &#8211;\u00a0is a republic\u00a0built on tragic events like the Holocaust, just as France is a country built on colonialism. This is not to say that countries and their residents are reducible to history. Rather it is to say that institutions and individuals are still intimately connected to what came before. It is about understanding how one can relate to such a history in its contemporary place, shaping either collective guilt or political activism (in the likes of Antifa) just the same. Everything has a context, and it is this context that immigrants to Germany should learn to understand for the sake of a more complete country &#8211; a civic society which respects differences and celebrates them. For Germany is not just for those who were once classified as &#8216;ethnically German&#8217;, it is for anyone that chooses to reside in Germany.
