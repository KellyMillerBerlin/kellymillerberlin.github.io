Within the waiting rooms and narrow offices of institutions serving immigrants, Roma are present and obvious, sticking out like a sore thumb without the opportunity for dialogue; they are talked about or talked around. <strong>And so one cannot talk about migration, diversity, and multicultural inclusion in Berlin without talking about how Lichtenberg talks about Roma.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the first Tuesday of every month, the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.migrantenrat.de\/\">Migrantenrat Lichtenberg<\/a>\u00a0<\/em>(immigrants&#8217; plenary) meets to address issues of migration affecting the district and its neighborhoods.

The economic element of Roma immigration is the primary reason the &#8216;Roma problem&#8217; has gained attention and notoriety, particularly in districts overwhelmed by rumors that may prove to be true.<\/p>\n<p>Since Bulgaria and Romania&#8217;s entrance into the European Union&#8217;s economic area, which allows for the transference of work permission and skills from one member state to the next, only partial admission into the German job market has been granted for citizens from these countries. Citing a wave of unqualified workers, often illiterate, into a strong market-driven economy, i.e. a wave of Roma, this act of exclusion became German federal policy. According to the European Union, Germany was acting in violation of economic rules of engagement and must retract its restricted work policy for immigrants from Bulgaria and Romania at the start of 2014. This affects Roma.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Most of the families are registered as self-employed<\/em>, Mrs. Olhagaray continued, <em>since they do not yet have the full benefits of EU citizenship, which grants them state assistance in many cases of difficulty. <\/em><\/strong>They wash windshields at traffic lights, peddle on the U-Bahn, play music in front of the mall entrance and somehow make ends meet.<em> They send most of their kids to school, as far as we are aware, and ensure that they learn German while they are there.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When she and her colleagues go by for a visit, she added, they are greeted with open arms, tea, and cake. <em>They know we are there to help them&#8230;and they need our help.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The room became silent, waiting for the evident problem to become clear.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>2014 will be a year of change for Roma in Berlin, primarily for those who have come from Bulgaria and Romania.<\/em>\u00a0<\/strong><em><strong>They will have access to the social welfare system, the situation will change dramatically<\/strong>,\u00a0<\/em>full stop.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/zigeuner.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1762\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/zigeuner.jpg\" alt=\"zigeuner\" width=\"312\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/zigeuner.jpg 312w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/zigeuner-227x300.jpg 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pi-news.net\/2013\/01\/einbrecher-asyl-antrage-von-zigeunern\/\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Legal change may not change bureaucracy over night.
