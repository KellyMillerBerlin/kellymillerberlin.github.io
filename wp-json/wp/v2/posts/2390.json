Certainly not the first institute of its kind in Germany, Berlin&#8217;s\u00a0Humboldt University, the Hertie Foundation, the Federal\u00a0Employment Agency, and the German Football Association held a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hu-berlin.de\/service\/veranstaltungen\/veranstaltungen_neu\/?stat=show&amp;vk_id=2715\">press conference<\/a> to frame\u00a0this initiative as new and needed. The reason: the field \u00a0&#8211; what is\u00a0really known about the integration or inclusion of diversity\u00a0&#8211; is more desert than rain-forest\u00a0in this country of immigration.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/bim-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2419\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/bim-7.jpg?w=550\" alt=\"BIM 7\" width=\"550\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/bim-7.jpg 535w, http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/bim-7-247x300.jpg 247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Improving the civic and social infrastructure of a city often begins with data. Aside from &#8220;Big Data&#8221; being the buzzword of 2014, plain ol&#8217; data is worth discussing. For <a href=\"http:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2014\/04\/14\/huge-new-york-development-project-becomes-a-data-science-lab\/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">data can instruct city planners, lawmakers, social workers etc. to better approach problems of urban spaces<\/a> and their economies, in ways which benefit residents, including the marginalized. It might just be common sense, but empirical research (the critical boots-on-the-ground kind) is an act of\u00a0taking stock of what is and what isn&#8217;t, which can prove quite useful in societies undergoing (or just learning to deal with) change.<\/p>\n<p>Data, in this sense, is information gathered to solve a problem or answer a question. According to all panelists at the press conference, whether researchers or community and\/or political stakeholders, this data is desperately required to answer the question of integration. Or is integration instead\u00a0a problem to be solved?<\/p>\n<p>As one of the not-so-timid anthropologists on the stage stated during the round of questions,\u00a0<em>What we are really taking about, when we talk about integration, is how to\u00a0learn to deal with and approach difference in society.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>The data imperative<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In light of Germany&#8217;s changing demography and political landscape, regarding immigration policy, the\u00a0categories and models used to understand and support local populations have become outdated, as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/international\/germany\/german-coalition-talks-move-closer-to-new-dual-citizenship-law-a-933523.html\">dual-citizenship debate<\/a> in German Parliament over the last few months has\u00a0indicated. More than just the classic census is required to capture the complexity of today&#8217;s metropolis. In Germany&#8217;s capital, where policy-makers brush shoulders with constituents and neighbors alike, real data could not be more in demand and yet, ironically, easier to find. This data goes beyond numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Given\u00a0this deficit of information and the few reasons for it,\u00a0the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refugees (BAMF)\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bundesregierung.de\/Content\/DE\/Pressemitteilungen\/BPA\/2014\/04\/2014-04-02-integration-kuratoriumsvorsitz.html\">has been actively involved in BMI&#8217;s founding<\/a>\u00a0and is set to be involved in its future;\u00a0\u00a0BAMF&#8217;s new\u00a0federal integration commissioner, Aydan \u00d6zo<span style=\"color: #435050;\">\u011f<\/span>uz<span style=\"color: #435050;\">,<\/span>\u00a0is a key member of the BIM board.

In\u00a02006, the DFB employed\u00a0its very own integration commissioner to better\u00a0navigate\u00a0the challenging combination of passionate football fans, visible diversity, and racism. A sweeping anti-racism campaign has been the culmination\u00a0of these efforts, <em>though much is still to be learned<\/em>, Niersbach said. <em>Our hope for this institute is to get some more solid ground under our feet, to learn more about what works and what doesn&#8217;t work. <\/em>It is a learning process, and it begins with better information.<\/p>\n<p>A key research focus of the new institute is the relationship between sports and integration,\u00a0e.g., the participation\u00a0of youth with migration backgrounds in local football clubs. But the playing field is different in football; <em>integration happens everyday, as 40% of the players have non-German backgrounds,<\/em> Niersbach mentioned emphatically, looking down the table at colleagues to see their reactions. To boot, social or ethnic differences are experienced on a more intensive and yet common-place\u00a0level (at least organizationally) in football, compared to German society at large.<\/p>\n<p>Niersbach\u00a0explained:\u00a0<em>Two talented football players grow up in\u00a0Nuremberg\u00a0playing together, they both go professional, they both have\u00a0Turkish backgrounds. One day, one of them calls us\u00a0up and says that he has decided to play for the Turkish national team, the other for the German national team. We are completely fine with that! We let them do what they want to do! But it was not always like that.\u00a0<\/em>Times have changed, and so should terms and categories (the dual-citizenship debate, once again case-in-point).<\/p>\n<p><strong>A clarification of terms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The institute&#8217;s projects, team of researchers, sponsors, as well as its leadership, are truly diverse. Inter-disciplinary and embracing of different methodologies and languages of information, the institute seeks to embody what it studies, something Dr. Sebastian Braun, Director of BIM, emphasized throughout his introduction. A football advocate\u00a0seated next to a well-known political scientist and culture critic;\u00a0\u00a0anthropologists gawking at the government employee over-using\u00a0the word &#8216;foreigner&#8217;; clinical psychiatrists tolerating the tactics of the employment agency,\u00a0in dealing with issues of health and job competency. Diversity has to begin somewhere.<\/p>\n<p>But where it will certainly prove to get messy is in this sticky, touchy realm of language.<\/p>\n<p>Frank J. Weiser of the Federal Employment Agency spoke from the perspective of the market-driven\u00a0state, the key aim of which is full employment and a balanced checkbook: <em>We want to improve our work with <\/em>Ausl\u00e4nder\u00a0(foreigners)&#8230;<em>many of these foreigners\u00a0have access to entitlement programs and experience higher unemployment than their German counterparts. I just work with the numbers, <\/em>he said smiling, seeming\u00a0pleased with his honesty. <em>Social cohesion, approaching difference &#8211; but what about jobs?!<\/em>, he might have said.<\/p>\n<p>The fissure\u00a0between practice, policy, and the ideals of academia is still there and not likely to go away.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3410\" style=\"width: 646px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3410\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3410 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/bim-3.jpg\" alt=\"Director of German Football Association, Rep.

How\u00a0strange it was to hear a term describing kids born or raised in Germany, kids that play football in Germany as foreign:\u00a0<em>There are kids that play on our teams that are different, yes, but they play together&#8230;\u00a0these kids don&#8217;t need to be integrated just because they happen to have a different skin tone.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The most vocal of the anthropologists, Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Kaschuba, director of Humboldt University&#8217;s European-Anthropology Department, agreed with this critique, bringing the other oddly-applied term <em>Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund<\/em>\u00a0(people with migration background)\u00a0into the discussion. It is not just about the word &#8220;foreigner&#8221;, which connotes otherness, apart-ness; rather, the problem lies with the\u00a0terms themselves,\u00a0how they shift from one individual or community to the next without time for distinction &#8211; <em>that is the humorous aspect in all of it<\/em> and the aspect worth exploration, i.e. empirical research. <em>I don&#8217;t used the word Ausl\u00e4nder at all, but I do use <\/em>Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund<em>, though I shorten it to MMH, and I say it M-M-H just to emphasize the irony of these terms in the German debate.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To close this round of questions, the Director of Humboldt University added, <em>When we are talking about integration, we are focusing on those people who have decided to stay in Germany, to live here, to work here.\u00a0<\/em>But what does it mean to &#8220;decide&#8221;? To stay? To live? No one at the front of the room\u00a0mentioned citizenship laws, legal frameworks regarding work and residency permission, or those political ideologies that might bar any empirical work\u00a0on terminology from having real impact in Parliament. Surely, data for this will be gathered, but the question is, who will listen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Taking stock<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In response to a question from the <em>Tagesspiegel, as to how this institute plans to transfer its knowledge to policy-makers<\/em>, Naika Forouton, the Representative Director of the institute, responded, <em>One of the purposes of the institute is to move away from a one-sided discourse that we have all experienced&#8230;[However], We do not see that as our job, delivering some report to policy-makers.

In 2012, she contributed to a volume of policy analyses for MPI.\u00a0Policy analysis and the effects thereof constitute a large part of her professional activities, in fact. Perhaps the difference lies in the medium.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, federal integration commissioner, Aydan \u00d6zo<span style=\"color: #435050;\">\u011f<\/span>uz, described the field to be investigated by the new BIM as deserted, barren. And to that,\u00a0<em>Immigrants have been here\u00a0a long time, but now they are simply increasing. The current discourse is dominated by fear; it is a fear-laden process.
