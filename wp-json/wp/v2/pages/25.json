After finishing her studies in Seattle in 2011, she packed an over-sized backpack and headed to Berlin for better and\/or different prospects. One year of visa tribulations and countless ventures later, she followed her passion for\u00a0ethnography\u00a0to a Master&#8217;s in Social and Cultural\u00a0Anthropology at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin. Through\u00a0coordinating a peer-sponsorship program for immigrants in the city, she conducted qualitative research on various facets of the German immigrant integration landscape; she completed her degree in 2014 with a thesis on immigrants, welfare, and social work practice in two Berlin neighborhoods. She looks forward to new opportunities\u00a0for\u00a0research, writing, and\/or collaboration on the intersections between anthropology, immigration, and inclusive policies.\u00a0To get in touch:\u00a0kelly.m.miller (at) outlook.com.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Read more: <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/lens-going-away\/\">Going (away)<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/collidoscopeberlin.local\/author\/kelly-miller\/\">All articles<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sophia<\/strong> stems from an international home in one of the world\u2019s most international cities: Washington, DC.

Her employment history includes the French Ministry of Education, the Migration Policy Institute, and Nobel Education Network.
