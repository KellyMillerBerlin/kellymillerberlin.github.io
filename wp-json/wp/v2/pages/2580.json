On a map, these borders seem relatively arbitrary: meandering lines awkwardly encircling blurbs of land. And yet in our lives, the purpose they are meant to serve is anything but, as borders demarcate political, legal, and bureaucratic spaces, as much as they do geographic ones. For it is not geography &#8211; the land itself &#8211; that keeps us from coming and going. It is our (hu)man-made political systems and governments that determine who is permitted to enter or leave, to immigrate or emigrate, to belong or not to belong.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the presence of these borders, we all make our way across these lines one way or another. Whether through relationships abroad, use of technology, involvement in international groups, or participation in the global economy: our lives are increasingly global and less tied to the borders in which we were born or reside. While this does not automatically make us all global citizens (which necessitates awareness and action), it fosters connections across borders that reinforce the idea of a world community. How can we reconcile this ever-present reality with our understanding of borders and restrictions on an individual\u2019s freedom of movement?<\/p>\n<p>The majority of us \u2013 more than ever before &#8211; lives in cities. Thanks largely to migration, modern cities have become microcosms of the global community, home to spectacular cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity. While this \u201ccollision\u201d of cultures can pose challenges, it is also a tremendous opportunity for growth and enrichment. <strong>If we begin to view our cities\u2019 pockets and spaces of difference as opportunities \u2013 becoming more empathetic, inclusive, and participatory in the process \u2013 we can begin to realize global values within local communities.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Berlin, Germany is one example: a city with a long history of attracting those who are \u201cdifferent\u201d, where 1 in every 4 residents is of foreign origin and 138 countries are represented. A city that is undergoing constant transformation, while undertaking the challenge of integrating not only newcomers, but the 2nd and 3rd generations. A city that is brimming with rich diversity and teeming with opportunities.<strong>\u00a0Collidoscope Berlin is a celebration of these stories and opportunities, a conversation-starter, a democratic and inclusive view of the many peoples, spaces, and settings that constitute the modern city.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This manifesto will surely change, as more lessons come to be and stories shift with the political terrain. With this in mind,\u00a0please contact us\u00a0with your questions, comments, or ideas for collaboration. This is an ever-evolving project in progress, and we are ever excited to learn.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Berlin is a city full of\u00a0every imaginable type of difference, from the working class block\u00a0within\u00a0the flashy district to the streets of Turkish imports and ancient Berliner pubs.\u00a0We see diversity as a constitutive element, enriching our common spaces with nuance and contrast, in ways often left out of political debates on so-called &#8216;integration&#8217;.
