                    <p>Saturday, the 18th of April, a small fishing vessel capsized off the coast of Libya on its way to
                        one of the European Union’s coastal states. On its way, it passed through waters patrolled by
                        the European Union&#8217;s security agency, Frontex. Its demise was quick, only 28 passengers
                        were rescued; an estimated 900 are said to have perished. Of the dead, roughly 200 had had
                        little chance of escape, locked securely in the ship&#8217;s hull by the smugglers commissioned
                        with their passage. A similar event had made headlines just the Sunday before: 400 dead in the
                        water. Yet even more sobering is the UN&#8217;s projected number of migrant deaths by the end
                        of 2015:
                        <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11548995/Mediterranean-migrant-crisis-hits-Italy-as-EU-ministers-meet-live.html">approximately
                            30,000</a>.</p>

                    <p>Although this tally of the dead got its start long ago, both the number and its surrounding
                        political situation seem to be escalating at an alarming rate. It is possible that this
                        escalation is, in part, due to the quick reporting the digital-age affords a global
                        readership. But, given the current death toll and its greater context of inter-regional
                        instability, one thing seems fairly certain: If safer pathways for migration to the European
                        Union continue to remain restricted or inaccessible to many, the intersecting lines of risk and
                        desperation will continue to make safety subordinate to a chance at what is (presented as) a
                        better life.</p>
                    <p>Yet the most immediate and real consequence of these reports of danger leading to disaster
                        may not be deterrence but desensitization: The drowned and discarded may begin to shock a little
                        less with each headline, and, worse yet, public support for the displaced &#8211; in our
                        communities, off our shores, and even in those far-off lands to which our governments sell arms
                        in exchange for cheap manufactured goods (an oversimplification of the global balance of trade,
                        of course, but the point remains a valid one) &#8211; may wane.</p>
                    <p>But this doesn&#8217;t have to be the case. This article is intended to inform, as well as to
                        encourage advocacy and action. As any seasoned volunteer or activist knows, engagement relies
                        heavily on context, identifying not only how to get involved but why and in which capacity,
                        based on the complex landscape of need one encounters. And so, I will first offer a summary of
                        information I find important in creating this context, beginning with an understanding of
                        Germany&#8217;s position in the asylum system of the European Union and followed by an unpacking
                        of certain terms and categories. The latter is not meant to distinguish between and thus arrange
                        various grades of human value based on one&#8217;s reasons for migration; rather, examining
                        these categories is an attempt to identify and elucidate the different contours and sites of
                        vulnerability to be found in refugee and immigrant advocacy, with navigating such categories
                        being crucial to successful support. The most important bit follows these term-laden sections
                        &#8211; namely, a list of ways to get involved in Berlin housing facilities and neighborhood
                        support centers for asylum-applicants. Some options for digital activism and direct actions
                        around Germany will also be included for our readers further afield.</p>
                    <p>In the end, my hope is to transform this article into a helpful resource page for the <em>Collidoscope</em>
                        webpage. Thus feedback on ways to improve its information and add to or amend its list of
                        opportunities for involvement is greatly appreciated!</p>
                    <p><strong>Asylum in the EU and refugee status in Germany: an overview</strong></p>
                    <p>It is helpful to continue with numbers as a means of illustrating the magnitude of the
                        situation (despite my preference for qualitative vs. purely quantitative data &#8211; for which
                        this blog tends to be a perfect example). In 2014, Germany housed approximately 173,000
                        applicants for asylum, an increase of 192% from the previous year. By the end of 2015, upwards
                        of 300,000 applicants for asylum are projected to enter and remain temporarily in the country
                        [source: <a href="http://www.bamf.de/DE/Infothek/Statistiken/Asylzahlen/asylzahlen-node.html">BAMF</a>].
                        Despite its shock-value, this remains a small number in the grand scheme of immigration flows.
                        Relative to the asylum policies of the other G-20 countries, however, this is a significant
                        number. The United States, for example, processed 121,000 asylum claims in 2014, a country with
                        four times the population of Germany [source:
                        <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/new-migration-crisis-overwhelms-european-refugee-system/2015/04/21/3ab83470-e45c-11e4-ae0f-f8c46aa8c3a4_story.html">Washington
                            Post</a>].</p>
                    <p>This does not mean that all claims and their applicants are granted residency in Germany. In
                        fact, most are rejected, resulting in deportation either once a decision has been reached or in
                        a temporary stay of inevitable deportation. Only 24% were granted refugee status in 2014, which
                        excludes a guarantee of permanent status, i.e. returning &#8220;status-refugees&#8221; to their
                        countries of origin once conflicts can be said to be resolved. Last year, only 1.8% received the
                        coveted gift of permanent asylum [source:
                        <a href="http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Broschueren/broschuere-bundesamt-in-zahlen-2014-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationFile">BAMF</a>].
                    </p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, 2014&#8217;s final tally of approximately 34,000 accepted refugees indicates a lag
                        in the participation of other EU member states, such as the Netherlands, Poland, or Ireland, not
                        to mention the strange and ineffective logic behind the so-called Dublin III convention*. As the
                        commissioner for the German federal agency for migration and refugees, Aydan Özoguz, commented
                        just last week: “The European asylum system doesn’t work. Some countries are doing very little.
                        We are one of the richest countries and we want to help, but it’s not okay that Germany, Sweden
                        and France are taking 50 percent of the refugees, while other countries do nothing” [source:
                        <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/new-migration-crisis-overwhelms-european-refugee-system/2015/04/21/3ab83470-e45c-11e4-ae0f-f8c46aa8c3a4_story.html">Washington

                    <p>EU leaders met just last week in an emergency summit to discuss changes to this increasingly
                        dysfunctional system. Given Germany&#8217;s position as home to the greatest number of
                        asylum-applicants, decisions made here set both the moral and practical tone for the other
                        states in the European Union&#8217;s common asylum system &#8211; an infrastructure guided
                        less by comprehensive agreements and more by a few select rules. At the summit&#8217;s
                        conclusion, leaders agreed to invest more money in rescue efforts: more boats and life-vests for
                        the Mediterranean. But what of more legal, safe pathways into the European Union?</p>
                    <p>Over the last few days, arguments have been made for a reform to the immigration policies that
                        prevent potential workers from entering the country by legal means, unrelated to the conditions
                        for asylum but also free from the ardor of submitting a claim and waiting years for a decision. <a href="http://www.iwkoeln.de/presse/interviews/beitrag/michael-huether-in-der-welt-iw-fordert-mehr-fluechtlinge-fuer-deutschen-arbeitsmarkt-223062">According
                            to the Institut für deutsche Wirtschaft</a> (IW), one in five asylum-applicants has a
                        college degree and one in three are skilled in some trade or another. With German industry&#8217;s
                        sustained calls for increased immigration (to compensate for an aging or less
                        technically-skilled population), providing a more accelerated pathway to a safe life in Germany
                        for those migrants who qualify, while meeting the utilitarian imperative of the political
                        establishment, seems like a win-win. Traditional asylum and provisions for refugees would not be
                        eliminated, by any means, but the number of migrants from poor or conflict-ridden countries
                        would be allowed to increase, saving many the eventual rejection most asylum-applicants face
                        once they arrive in Europe, if they are lucky enough to survive the journey (see the
                        <a href="http://heindehaas.blogspot.de/2015/04/let-their-people-drown-how-eu.html">recent appeal
                            from social scientist Hein de Haas</a> for more on this argument).</p>
                    <p>However, as is often the case in coordinated responses to humanitarian need, calculations of
                        domestic burden vs. benefit will dominate. And an end to these calculations is nowhere in sight.
                        That is to say, if we wait for political change, we may be waiting at a high opportunity cost
                        &#8211; that of everyday advocacy for and support of the displaced. But
                        first, categories&#8230;</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8220;Refugee&#8221; or &#8220;asylum-seeker&#8221;?</strong></p>
                    <p>The distinction between those with refugee status and those who have submitted an application for
                        asylum (referred to as &#8220;asylum-applicant&#8221; thus far) is an important one, as it helps
                        to explain the origins and role of the <em>Flüchtlingsheim</em> (state-sponsored but
                        privately-run housing facility for asylum-applicants) in the everyday landscape of German towns
                        and cities, including Berlin. Of course, the implementation of national asylum law can
                        vary state by state, given Germany&#8217;s federal balance of power; Saxony, Bavaria, and Berlin
                        may differ in the scope and quantity of services provided to asylum-applicants residing in each
                        state&#8217;s respected <em>Flüchtlingsheime,</em> for example,<em> </em>as this
                        <a href="http://www.proasyl.de/de/news/detail/news/pro_asyl_studie_zur_unterbringung_von_fluechtlingen_in_deutschland/">study</a>
                        demonstrates. But, in all cases, the foundation of German asylum law is built on a
                        differentation between those whose claims have been adjudicated (decided by a judge in German
                        administrative court) and those who have filed claims but are awaiting a decision, assigning
                        different rights and restrictions to these different groups, accordingly. The most important
                        rights and restrictions are those affecting the freedom of movement and activity for those
                        migrants to fall in the &#8220;asylum-applicant&#8221; category. They are as follows:</p>
                    <p>&#8211; Asylum-applicants are generally not allowed to work until they receive formal status:
                        either as a &#8220;refugee&#8221; (a temporary status, in most cases), as an &#8220;asylee&#8221; (long-term
                        or permanent status), or as a &#8220;tolerated person&#8221; (<em>Geduldete</em>). There are, of
                        course, some exceptions to this rule; for example, asylum-applicants in Berlin and Brandenburg
                        are allowed to pursue employment one year after their application has been submitted, though
                        this work allowance remains heavily restricted and qualified. This means that, in general,
                        asylum-applicants are not able to provide for themselves, thereby becoming fully dependent on
                        the services financed by the federal government, the respective state, and third-parties
                        responsible for service provision. The housing facility system of the <em>Flüchtlingsheim</em> was
                        established both to meet the need for accommodation and to enforce this ban on employment.</p>
                    <p>&#8211; Up until January of this year, all asylum-applicants were to remain in the state
                        and district either in which they had applied for asylum or to which they had been assigned.
                        They were not able to determine this geographical location or the particular facility in which
                        they would live, even in the case of friends or relatives already in the country. These rules
                        for residency and domicile make up the German system of <em>Residenzpflicht.</em> According to
                        the organization Pro Asyl,
                        <a href="http://www.proasyl.de/de/themen/basics/basiswissen/rechte-der-fluechtlinge/bewegungsfreiheit/residenzpflicht/">these
                            restrictions have been partially lifted</a>. It is unclear, however, to what extent the
                        residency requirement will be relaxed. And as with any policy reform, there will certainly be a
                        lag in public officials and bureaucrats implementing changes. In other words, asylum-applicants
                        may still be prohibited (by staff and local enforcement personnel) from leaving their assigned
                        district, and limits to mobility may still be decided on a state-by-state and case-by-case
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>&#8211; Residents of <em>Flüchtlingsheime</em> are frequently re-distributed to prevent
                        over-crowding and to maintain an equitable distribution of the financial burden, relative to
                        each state&#8217;s population and economic situation. The freedom of movement, which the
                        abolition of <em>Residenzpflicht </em>may have provided, is overruled and/or overshadowed by
                        this re-distribution mandate.</p>
                    <p>&#8211; Once asylum-applicants have received a decision from the judge &#8211; the time between
                        the initial filing of the application, the hearing, and the eventual decision often proving to
                        be a year-long ordeal -, those without status granted are either returned to their country of
                        origin (often within a few months of the decision) or are given a <i>Duldung</i>, becoming a
                        &#8220;tolerated person&#8221; for as long as the state deems their return difficult (e.g. in
                        the case of illness, psychological distress, age, family relations, financial situation in the
                        country of origin). <em>Geduldete</em> are free to seek employment and live among the general
                        population, securing their own housing, albeit within the town/city of their asylum-application.
                        But, in most cases, they are not entitled to the same social services as those with refugee
                        status and can be deported at any time, particularly in the case of a minor infraction.</p>
                    <p>These terms serve to complicate the issue of refugees and the work of refugee advocacy, as
                        various levels of status and treatment before the law are at play. In my opinion, when the media
                        and public discourse fail to make these distinctions, the complexity of the issue and its effect
                        on the experience of real human beings is side-lined to a language that prefers the simplicity
                        of pure humanitarianism &#8211; a moral outlook recognized neither by German law-makers nor
                        by the structures of the European Union. In simple terms, those crossing the Mediterranean and
                        those living in close quarters in Berlin&#8217;s many <em>Flüchtlingsheime </em>are not all
                        &#8220;refugees&#8221;. If they were, they would receive the humane treatment popular opinion
                        affords them.</p>

                    <p>Yet, when we acknowledge that it is precisely because of the precarity of their status that they
                        need our help, the situation looks much different. And local interventions in the experience of
                        this precarity become most important, beyond #refugeeswelcome.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to help</strong></p>
                    <p>A few weeks ago I visited a new housing facility for asylum-applicants in Reinickendorf, one of
                        the northernmost districts of Berlin. In an idyllic setting, surrounded by pine and quiet
                        residential streets, a former High School has been converted into a 300 bed hostel for migrants
                        awaiting status. The space is rudimentary but well-organized, staff making do with donated toys
                        and German courses, among other diverse activities, as a means to entertain the many children
                        &#8211; many of whom have been waiting for more than two months to enroll in the local school.
                        The staff &#8211; about 10 in number &#8211; communicate with residents in what seems to be a
                        mix of German, English, French, and enthusiastic signage. There is an artist working on the
                        aesthetic revitalization of the place &#8211; literally making the dark halls of a High School a
                        place that feels like home for its residents. There are social workers and psychologists who
                        visit on occasion. Basic meals are catered three times a day on a set schedule. &#8220;House
                        Rules&#8221; are posted in various languages in the foyer. And security guards patrol the
                        grounds, which are clearly the remains of a once vibrant schoolyard, complete with a basketball
                        court (nets partially intact) and a covered concrete playground for jumping rope and hopscotch.
                        We chat about setting up in-house cooking activities, to bring residents and staff closer
                        together, and about using the open space to start a garden, giving the families an opportunity
                        to build and realize a strenuous but rewarding project, even harvest its fruits. The plans are
                        piece-meal and heavily reliant on donations and organizational finesse. In many ways, it is
                        simply about showing up (a familiar mantra), trying to be of help, and deferring to the staff
                        who are there throughout the week trying to make the facility a better place for all who live
                        there.</p>
                    <p>There are more than 40 facilities just like this one across Berlin, housing upwards of 11,000
                        asylum-applicants. <a href="http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article139453814/Senat-baut-36-neue-Fluechtlingsheime-in-Berlin.html">36
                            more facilities just like them are planned</a> for the end of 2015. The need is great, but
                        so is this city. Here is a list of established groups across Berlin who work directly with <em>Flüchtlingsheime </em>like
                        the one mentioned above; all of these organizations are certainly eager for new volunteers:</p>

                    <p><strong>Why local interventions matter</strong></p>
                    <p>A <a href="http://www.bim.hu-berlin.de/media/2015-05-16_EFA-Forschungsbericht_Endfassung.pdf">study</a> was
                        just released by the new <a href="http://www.bim.hu-berlin.de/">Berlin Institute for Empirical
                            Migration and Integration Research</a>* (BIM) on Berlin-based volunteer engagement  in
                        support of asylum-applicants and resettled refugees. It points to severe deficits in state
                        services for which the unpaid contributions of volunteers strive to remedy. In particular,
                        without the engagement of what the study deems predominately secular, middle-class females, many
                        asylum-applicants would have great difficulty communicating with those agencies charged with the
                        processing and, ultimately, the acceptance or rejection of their claim to refugee status.
                        Additionally, despite the <em>Trägerschaft </em>structure, in which third-party organizations
                        assume partial financial responsibility and full operational responsibility for these housing
                        facilities, many goods and services would otherwise be sorely lacking without the
                        donation-drives and supply deliveries of volunteers. The study describes the especially integral
                        role of volunteers in assisting in the navigation of Germany&#8217;s complex bureaucratic
                        structures: something necessary for immigrants of any sort to successfully remain in the
                        country.</p>

                        can have a great effect on an asylum-applicant&#8217;s success, encouraging language and

                        granted, seeing to the wellness of a <em>Flüchtlingsheim&#8217;s </em>residents is a powerful
                        intervention in an often bleak process. In the end, it is the state that decides who may be
                        called a &#8220;refugee&#8221; and who might have a chance at a better life, but volunteers may
                        prove to be one of the deciding factors in who will be welcomed.</p>

                    <p>*Technically, certain conventions of the European Union (such as the oft-cited Dublin III
                        agreement) requires that migrants seeking asylum, i.e. refugee status, apply for and receive
                        asylum for the first EU country on which they are said to have set foot. In practice, however,
                        Dublin III is inconsistently enforced, thus allowing asylum-applicants to submit a claim in an
                        economically prosperous country like Germany.</p>

                            <p>I recently arrived in Berlin, two weeks ago to shoot a documentary on the Refugee Crisis
                                from Australia. I found this article really helpful in detailing the plans of
                                volunteers, links to their websites and the overview of the whole situation. Thank you

                            <p>Great article. I&#8217;m moving to NRW soon and I&#8217;m wondering if you have any
                                contacts in the Detmold area who work with asylum seekers/refugees? Can you pls email
                                details if you have some?<br/>
                                Thank you for this.</p>
